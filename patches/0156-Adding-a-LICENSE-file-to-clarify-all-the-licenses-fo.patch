+   Modified from the Python-1.3 distribution for use in LambdaMOO
+   by Pavel Curtis, 27 October 1995.
+
+   This code draws many ideas from the regular expression packages by
+   Henry Spencer of the University of Toronto and Richard Stallman of the
+   Free Software Foundation.
+
+   Emacs-specific code and syntax table code is almost directly borrowed
+   from GNU regexp.
