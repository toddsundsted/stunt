+@unnumbered Introduction
+
+The LambdaCore database provides the facilities needed to make a
+LambdaMOO server useful for Multi User Adventuring.  If you compare the
+LambdaMOO server to a piece of computer hardware, then LambdaCore is the
+operating system needed to allow the user to do useful work.
+
+This document gives a rundown on the elements of the LambdaCore
+database, and provides details of each of the verbs used by the
+database.  It also provides source for some of the verbs, to aid
+understanding and provide extra information.  
+
+The user is assumed to have read the two companion manuals to this one,
+@dfn{The LambdaMOO Programmer's Manual} and @dfn{The LambdaCore User's
+Manual}.  An understanding of MOO concepts, the MOO language and the
+facilities provided by the LambdaCore database is needed to follow the
+explanations given in this document.
+
+@chapter The LambdaCore Classes
+
+The LambdaCore database provides several basic classes that are used to
+define the virtual world.  It is these classes that provide the
+@dfn{core} of any MOO database built on the LambdaCore database.  As
+well as defining obvious things like players, rooms and exits, the
+classes also provide all the commands used to interact with the
+database, and several utility functions for use by the MOO programmer
+writing his or her own verbs.
+
+The LambdaCore classes can be divided into two categories:
+
+@itemize @bullet
+@item
+Generics: These are classes containing generic objects, for example
+players, rooms, exits and so on.  If a new generic object is created, it
+would be placed in this list.
+@item 
+Utilities: These are classes containing utility verbs that can be used
+by other verbs.  Example include string utilities, trig functions etc.
+@end itemize
+
+The sections that follow describe the LambdaCore classes in detail,
+providing insight into what each verb and property is used for, and some
+idea of how they should be used in your own MOO programs.
+
+@section The LambdaCore Generic Classes
+
+The following generic classes are available in the LambdaCore database:
+
+@display
+@table @code
+@item The Root Class ($root_class)
+This is the basic class from which everything else in the database is
+descended.  It defines basic operations and properties on an object.
+
+@item The Generic Room ($room)
+This class is the parent for all the rooms in the database.
+
+@item The Mail Distribution Center ($mail_room)
+This is a special class used to define a room for dealing with MOO mail.
+It is a child of the generic @code{Room} class.
+
+@item The Generic Mail Recipient 
+To be written.
+
+@item The Generic Editor's Office ($editor)
+This is a special class used to define a room used for program editing.
+It is a child of the generic @code{Room} class.
+
+@item System Object (#0)
+This is the keystone object for the database.  It holds various important
+system properties, as well as pointers to the various other classes and
+objects that are system-wide.
+
+@item The Generic Thing ($thing)
+This class defines a TinyMUD style object, that is, something that can
+be picked up and put down.  It defines various messages related to
+taking and dropping the object.
+
+@item The Generic Container ($container)
+This is a child class of the @code{Thing} class.  A container is an
+object that can have other objects placed within it.
+
+@item The Generic Note ($note)
+A note is a child class of the @code{Thing} class.  It is used to store
+text messages, which may be encrypted.  A note can only be recycled by
+the owner.
+
+@item The Generic Letter ($letter)
+A letter is a child class of the @code{Note} class.  It provides the
+same facilities, but also has a @code{burn} verb which the recipient can
+use to recycle the letter.
+
+@item The Generic Player ($player)
+This is the class from which all players are descended.
+
+@item The Generic Programmer ($prog)
+This is a child of the @code{Player} class used for players that are MOO
+programmers.  It defines a set of verbs that are useful for programming
+activities. 
+
+@item The Generic Wizard ($wiz)
+This is a child of the @code{generic programmer} class, used for
+wizards.
+
+@item The Generic Exit.  ($exit)
+This class defines a generic exit used to link one object of class
+@code{Room} to another object of class @code{Room}.  It defines a
+number of messages that may be generated when an exit is used.
+@end table
+@end display
+
+@subsection The Root Class
+
+The root class is the base class from which all objects are descended.
+It is the keystone of the database and defines fundamental verbs and
+properties common to every object.  If you are a programmer (ie, you
+have a player object with the @dfn{programmer} bit set) you can examine
+the properties and verbs of the root class using the command
+
+@example
+@@show $root_class
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+You can examine the code for a verb on the class by using, for
+example, the following command.
+
+@example
+@@list $root_class:description
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+This lists the program definition for the verb
+@code{$root_class:description}.  An interesting point to note is that
+this code can be changed by the owner - in this case the Wizard - to
+provide any functionality desired.  This configurability of the basis of
+the whole LambdaCore database allows a large degree of flexibility in
+the way the LambdaMOO server is used.  It also allows for very subtle and
+perplexing problems. Care must be taken when editing definitions on any
+of the fundamental classes, the @code{$root_class} in particular.
+However, as the base classes of the LambdaCore database have been
+thoroughly tested and debugged, there should be very little need for any
+changes by the average database administrator.
+
+The following section lists the verb and property definitions for the
+@code{$root_class}.  For each verb, a description of it's function is
+given, along with any interesting points.  The intent is to present each
+verb in such a way that it is possible to grasp the whole picture,
+rather than just looking at the individual brushstrokes.
+
+@deftypefn Verb string description ()
+The @code{:description} verb on any object is supposed to return a
+string or list of strings describing the object in the detail someone
+would notice if they were specifically looking at it.  
+
+The default implementation of the "look" command (defined on the
+@code{$room} class), prints this description using the @code{:look_self}
+verb on the object.  @code{:look_self} uses @code{:description} to
+obtain the text to display.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none describe (@var{value})
+The @code{:describe} verb is used to set the description property of an
+object.  This is only allowed if we have permission, determined using
+the @code{$perm_utils:controls()} verb.  By overriding this verb and the
+@code{:description} verb, it is possible to completely change the
+representation of an object description.  This is done invisibly to
+anyone outside the object, as long as you adhere to the same interface
+to @code{:description} and @code{:describe}.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none look_self ()
+The @code{:look_self} verb on any object is used to @code{:tell} another
+object what this object looks like, in detail.  This verb makes use of
+the @code{:description} verb on the object to obtain a string or list of
+strings to print.  It would be possible to override this verb to produce
+a special description for an object.  However, any other verbs that use
+the @code{:description} verb of the object will not see the extra
+information added by the overriding function.  The @code{$room} class
+overrides this verb with code to print the room @code{name} and a list
+of objects that are in the room.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none tell (string @var{strings}, @dots{})
+This verb is used to send a message from one object to another.  The
+@code{$root_class} definition of this verb tests to see if the object is
+a player, and if it is, uses the @code{notify} primitive to print the
+argument list on the player's screen, if they are connected.  However,
+this verb can be overridden to allow arbitrary objects to pass messages
+between each other, or to augment the way the message is handled.
+
+One simple example is that of an object that listens to everything that
+happens in a room.  Every verb that needs to send text to players uses
+the @code{:tell} verb.  If an object has it's own @code{:tell} verb, it
+too will be able to act upon the messages sent between objects in a
+room.
+
+The @code{$player} class overrides this verb to filter messages in two
+different ways, as show below:
+
+@example
+if (typeof(this.gaglist) != LIST || !(player in this.gaglist))
+  if (player != this && this.paranoid == 1)
+    pass("<", player.name, "(", player, ")> ", @@args);
+  else
+    pass(@@args);
+  endif
+endif
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+Firstly, if the message comes from a player that we don't want to listen
+to - the player has been @dfn{gagged} - then the message is thrown away.
+Secondly, if the player is being @dfn{paranoid}, and the message is not
+from ourselves, it is prefaced with the name of the originating object.
+The @code{pass} primitive is used to allow the @code{:tell} verb of the
+parent class to send the message after it has been modified.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none moveto (obj @var{where})
+This verb is used to change the location of an object to be @var{where}.
+The built-in function @code{move()} is used by this verb. Any
+error codes generated by it are returned by this function.  This verb is
+intended to be used by any other verbs that must move an object to
+another location.
+
+One important point to note is that this uses the
+@code{set_task_perms()} primitive to set the task permissions to those
+of the thing that is being moved.
+
+Again, by overriding the verb definition on an object, it is possible to
+augment or change the way an object is moved.  For example, you could
+keep a list of places visited by simply recording the @var{where}
+objects in a list every time this function is called.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb num accept (obj @var{thing})
+This verb is used to control what objects are permitted to be placed
+@dfn{inside} other objects.  If this verb returns @samp{0}, then the
+object @var{where} cannot be moved into this object.  Conversely, if the
+verb returns a non-zero value, the object is allowed to be placed inside
+this object.  The verb is called by the server when it executes a
+@code{move()} primitive.
+
+The @code{$root_class} definition returns a zero value.  In this case,
+no objects are allowed inside any objects that are children of the
+@code{$root_class}.  The @code{$room} class definition provides for a
+flexible scheme using various different criteria, as shown in the
+following code :
+
+@example
+what = args[1];
+return this:is_unlocked_for(what) && 
+       (this.free_entry || 
+       what.owner == this.owner || 
+       (typeof(this.residents) == LIST && what in this.residents));
+@end example
+
+Starting at the top of the conditional expression, we see the locking
+condition being checked.  If the room lock forbids this object to enter
+the room, then the @code{:accept} verb returns zero.  
+
+If this is not the case, then we consider the value of the
+@code{free_entry} property.  If this is set to a non-zero value, then
+the object is allowed to enter the room.
+
+If the owner of an object is the owner of a room, the object is allowed
+to enter.
+
+Finally, if a @code{residents} list is defined in the room, and the
+object is in the list, then it is allowed to enter.
+
+This complex set of conditions shows how an arbitrary set of criteria
+can be applied to the movement of objects into other objects.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb obj match (string @var{name})
+This verb is used to find things that are located within this
+object.  It tries to match @var{name} to something in the contents list
+of this object, using object names and object aliases.  This verb uses
+the @code{$string_utils:match()} verb to do the actual searching.  If a
+match is found, the object that matched is returned.  If more than one
+object matches, then @code{$ambiguous_match} is returned.  If no match
+is found, then @code{$failed_match} is returned.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none exam*ine ()
+This prints out some useful information about the object to the player.
+It is provided as a player command, to allow every player to determine
+basic information about any other objects they come across.  For
+example,
+
+@example
+>exam #0
+The System Object (#0) is owned by Wizard (#2).
+Aliases:  The, Known, and Universe
+(No description set.)
+@end example
+
+The idea is to allow every player to discover the owner, full name,
+description and aliases of any object.
+
+If you control the object, the lock for the object is shown.  If the
+object has other objects inside it, then the contents list is printed
+out, too.  If the object has verbs defined on it, then these verbs are
+listed, provided they are readable, and have not been hidden by setting
+the argument specifiers to the triplet @samp{this}, @samp{none}
+@samp{this}.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none tell_lines (list @var{strings})
+This outputs out the list of strings @var{strings} to the object, using the
+@code{tell} verb for this object.  Each string in @var{strings} is
+output on a separate line.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb num set_name (string @var{value})
+This verb sets the name of the object to @var{value}.  It returns `1' if
+the name was set to the @var{value} successfully, otherwise it returns
+`0'.  This verb, and the @code{:title} verb are used to control access
+to the @code{name} property of an object.  
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb num is_unlocked_for (obj @var{thing})
+Returns `1' if the object is unlocked for the argument.  If the value of
+@code{this.key} is zero, the object is unlocked.  If this is not the
+case. the verb @code{$lock_utils:eval_key()} is used to determine the
+result.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb string title ().
+This verb is used to get the @code{name} property of this object.  
+
+One example where it might be useful to redefine this verb is if you
+want to add an honorific or descriptive phrase to the end of your name.
+By overriding the @code{:title} verb, you can append anything you like
+to the @code{:name} property of the object.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none recycle ()
+This verb contains no code for the @code{$root} class.  It is called by
+the @code{recycle()} primitive just before an object is recycled.  This
+is useful to make sure that recycling objects does not leave the
+database in a strange state.  For example, the @code{$exit} class uses
+the @code{:recycle} verb to remove the exit from the the @dfn{entrance}
+and @dfn{exit} lists of its destination and source rooms.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb string titlec ()
+This verb performs the same function as the @code{title} verb, but
+returns a capitalised version of the @code{name} property of the object,
+using the @code{$string_utils:cap_property} verb.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none eject ()
+This verb is used to remove something from the contents of an object.
+The owner of an object, or a wizard, can use this verb to eject a victim
+from inside the object.  The victim is sent to @code{$nothing}, for most
+objects, or to @code{$player_start} if the victim is a player.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@noindent
+The root class defines a few basic properties that every object has.
+The verbs discussed above make reference to these properties - as well
+as the built in properties @code{name}, @code{owner}, @code{location},
+@code{contents}, @code{programmer}, @code{wizard}, @code{r} and
+@code{w}. 
+The following properties are defined for the root class:
+
+@defvr Property key
+This is used to determine what, if anything, an item is locked to.
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property aliases
+This gives a list of the alternative names that can be used to refer to
+an object. The value of this property should be a list of strings, the
+various alternatives for naming the object.  Note that the name of the
+object in question should be included in this list, because the built in
+name matcher uses only the @code{aliases} property when searching for
+matches.
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property description
+This is a string or list of strings giving the description of the object
+- what we see when we @code{look} at the object.
+@end defvr
+
+@subsection The Room Class
+
+The @code{Room Class} is the basic class from which all the @dfn{rooms}
+in the virtual world are descended. It is one of the very basic classes
+essential to constructing a virtual world; an @code{exit} is the other
+essential class.
+
+A room can be thought of as a container for players and objects.  It
+can have a number of exits that connect it to other rooms.   These exits
+are directed; they lead @dfn{from} one room @dfn{to} another room.  For
+a two way passage to exist, two exits are needed, going in opposite
+directions.
+
+The room class defines a lot of verbs, which are used to provide
+an interface to the properties of the room.
+
+One special point is worth noting about rooms and exits.  An exit can
+have an arbitrary name - indeed, this is the usual case.  In order for
+the room to recognise the exit name, and match it up with an exit that
+exists in the room, some form of @dfn{catchall} mechanism is used.  If a
+player types a sentence that the parser cannot match with anything, it
+executes a verb called @code{:huh} in the current room, if one exists.
+
+When this happens, the @code{:huh} verb is free to take the player's
+sentence, search for a valid exit, and act accordingly.  This mechanism
+provides a very flexible arrangement for dealing with exits, and also
+allows a degree of player help to be added.  If a close match to a
+command is found, the @code{huh} verb could detect this and provide a
+useful response that would help the player construct the correct
+sentence.
+
+The following section lists the verbs defined for the @code{$room}
+class.  Those verbs which are more properly described as player commands
+are detailed in a preceding section.
+
+@deftypefn Verb none confunc ()
+This verb is called by the LambdaMOO server when a player connects in a
+room.  The action coded into the @code{$room} class simply shows the
+player what the room looks like (using the @code{:look_self} verb of the
+room) and tells everyone else in the room that the player has connected.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none disfunc ()
+This verb is called by the LambdaMOO server when a player disconnects
+from the game.   The @code{$room} class definition of this verb moves
+the player home if s/he is not already there, using the @code{:moveto}
+verb on the player.  One possible enhancement of this verb, already
+implemented in some MOOs, is to include a time delay between
+disconnection and movement of the player to his/her home.  This would
+allow some tolerance of disconnection due to network problems.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none say (string @var{message})
+This verb provides one of the basic ways in which players communicate.
+The action of the @code{:say} verb is very simple: it @code{:tell}s the
+player what s/he has just said, and tells everyone else what the player
+said. The text spoken is passed to all the objects in a room, not just
+the players, through the @code{:tell} verbs on the objects in the room.
+
+By overriding this verb, it is possible to provide all sorts of effects
+that work on everything said in the room.  For example, you could
+redirect messages to other rooms, or repeat messages to provide
+cavernous echoes.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none emote (string @var{message})
+This verb is used for the @dfn{pose} type of interaction with other
+players.  It functions in a similar way to the @code{:say} verb, but
+instead places the player's name at the front of the text.  The actual
+output is done in two stages.  The @code{:emote} verb is responsible for
+telling the player the action s/he has just performed.  The
+@code{emote1} verb is then called to tell the other objects in the room
+of the @code{pose} action.  This provides a two stage mechanism; either
+or both of the verbs can be overridden to provide special effects.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none emote1 (string @var{message})
+This verb is invoked by the @code{emote} verb to send the @dfn{emote}
+text to the other objectss in the room.  By overriding this verb, it is
+possible to create special effects for @code{emote} actions that are
+only seen by the other people in a room.  @code{:emote1} uses
+@code{$room:announce} to send it's message.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none announce (string @var{message})
+This verb is a general purpose verb used to send a message to every
+object in the room except the player that invoked it.  This is intended
+to be the way other verbs pass messages to objects in a room.  For
+example, when an exit is activated, it uses @code{:announce} to inform
+the other players in the room of what has happened.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none announce_all_but (list @var{@@args})
+This general purpose verb is used to send a message to everyone in the
+room @dfn{except} a particular object.  This can be used in situations
+where we wish to present one view to the world in general, and another
+view to a particular object, normally a player.  Another common usage is
+to prevent robots that trigger actions based on a redefined
+@code{:tell()} verb on themselves from recursing, using something like
+
+@example
+place:announce_all_but(this, "message");
+@end example
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none huh (string @var{sentence})
+This verb is a stub used to call the @code{huh2} verb.  It is called by
+the LambdaMOO server when it can't match a sentence given to it by a
+player.  The server calls @code{:huh} with @code{verb} equal to the
+actual verb in the erroneous command line.  This means it is not
+possible to use @code{pass()} if you override @code{:huh} in a room; it
+would pass control up to a verb on the parent named @code{verb}, i.e.,
+whatever the verb was on the command line.  This, by definition, doesn't
+exist.  To get around this, and allow you to use @code{pass()} to get
+the default @code{:huh} behaviour, @code{:huh} calls @code{:huh2}.  You
+should override @code{:huh2} if you wish to be able to use @code{pass()}
+to get the default @code{:huh} behaviour.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb obj match_exit (string @var{exit})
+This verb is used to determine if @var{exit} is the name of an exit
+leading out of the room.  It performs a simple string match on the names
+and aliases of the objects in the @code{exits} list stored as a property
+of the room.  The intent here is to allow for more sophisticated
+matching algorithms to be implemented.  One might even go so far as
+implementing a fuzzy matching scheme, to allow for player misspellings.
+If a successful match is made, this signifies that an exit with the name
+@var{exit} leads from this room.  It's object number is returned.  If
+more than one match is found the value @code{$ambiguous_match} is
+returned. If no match is found, the value @code{$failed_match} is
+returned.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb num add_exit (obj @var{exit})
+This verb is used to add @var{exit} to the list of exits leading out of
+the room.  This verb, and the @code{:match_exit} verb provide the
+interface to the room exits list.  The way in which exits are stored,
+removed and matched has been separated from the interface so that
+different implementations of the @dfn{exits} concept can be used in
+different sub classes of the @code{$room} class.
+
+If it is not possible to add @var{exit} to the room's exit list
+(normally because the object that invoked the verb does not have the
+required permission) then the verb returns `0'.  Otherwise, a successful
+addition returns `1'.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none tell_contents ()
+This verb tells us what things are visible in the room.  It goes through
+the @code{contents} list of the room, and if it is not dark, prints the
+name of the object in a nicely formatted way.  Three different formats
+are available depending on the value of the @code{ctype} property of the
+room.  These are best illustrated by example.
+
+Consider the a room in the LambdaCore database.  With a @code{ctype}
+value of three (the default), the @code{tell_contents} verb produces the
+following output:
+
+@example
+You see a newspaper and a fruitbat zapper here.
+Wizard is here.
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+This format provides the separation of player objects from other
+objects, and provides the list in a way that fits in with the idea of a
+virtual reality.  It is easy to read, and looks natural.
+
+If the @code{ctype} value is changed to 2, the following is printed:
+
+@example
+You see Wizard, a newspaper, and a fruitbat zapper here.
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+This format treats players and objects the same, and is useful if you
+wish to hide the fact that an object is not a player, or vice versa.
+
+With a @code{ctype} value of one, the following is seen:
+
+@example
+Wizard is here.
+You see a newspaper here.
+You see a fruitbat zapper here.
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+This format provides the advantage of having each item on a separate
+line, although it does mean that rooms with a large number of objects in
+might have excessively long contents lists.
+
+Finally, with a @code{ctype} of zero, the following is seen:
+
+@example
+Contents:
+  Wizard
+  a newspaper
+  a fruitbat zapper
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+This is the sort of listing obtained in traditional TinyMU* games.  It
+benefits from clarity, but is not as natural as any of the other forms.
+
+If a value of @code{ctype} is set that is outside of the range zero thru
+three, then no contents list is printed.  This can be useful if you want
+to handle the room contents listing as part of the description of the
+room.  Also, if the @code{dark} property of a room is set to a non-zero
+value, then no contents list is printed.
+
+As usual, this verb can be overridden to provide special effects.  For
+example, you could apply a filter so that certain objects do not appear
+in the printed contents of a room, even if they appear in the contents
+list.  This can be use to hide objects, for example, as part of a
+puzzle, or to vary how objects are seen, for example if you are looking
+through water at something.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb obj match_object (string @var{name})
+This is the verb used to search the player's locale for an object that
+has the name or pseudonym @var{name}.  This verb handles mapping of
+@code{me} to the player object, @code{here} to the player's location as
+well as the use of @code{#<number>} to refer to a particular object.  If
+none of these cases match, the verb searches the room contents and the
+players contents (or possessions) for a match.  If a match is found,
+then the unique object number is returned.   If @var{name} matches more
+than one object, then @code{$ambiguous_match} is returned.  If no match
+is found, then @code{$failed_match} is returned.
+
+The verb @code{:match_object} is the one to use to map names of objects
+to object numbers, when referring to objects that the player is able to
+@dfn{see} in his current location.  This includes objects that the
+player might be carrying, but does not include objects that are
+@dfn{contained} in other objects.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none @@exits ()
+This verb is a player command used to print a list of the exits in a
+room.  It can only be used by the owner of the room.  The verb simply
+runs through the list of defined exits, stored in the property
+@code{exits}, and prints the exit name, object reference number,
+destination name, and exit aliases.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none look_self ()
+This verb overrides the @code{$root_class} definition of the verb
+@code{:look_self} in order to provide a fuller description of a room
+than the @code{description} property gives.  This verb prints the room
+name, followed by the room's @code{description} property, and then the
+list of contents of the room, using the room's @code{:tell_contents}
+verb.  This is what the player would see if he was looking at the room.
+
+The @code{description} property of the room is actually printed
+by using the @code{pass()} primitive to invoke the parent verb
+@code{:look_self}).  Changes in the way an object's description is stored
+by the root class are invisible to this verb, because of the way
+@code{pass} is used.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb num accept (object @var{thing})
+This verb overrides the @code{$root_class} definition.  The
+@code{$room_class} definition provides for a flexible scheme using various
+different criteria.  The idea is to allow the builder flexibility in
+preventing objects from moving into the room. The following code shows
+how the @code{$room:accept} verb decides whether to allow @var{thing} to
+enter the room or not.
+
+@example
+what = args[1];
+return this:is_unlocked_for(what) && 
+       (this.free_entry || 
+       (what==this.blessed_object&&task_id()==this.blessed_task) ||
+       what.owner == this.owner || 
+       (typeof(this.residents) == LIST && what in this.residents));
+@end example
+
+Starting at the top of the conditional expression, we see the locking
+condition being checked.  If the room lock forbids this object to enter
+the room, then the @code{:accept} verb returns zero.  
+
+If this is not the case, then we consider the value of the
+@code{free_entry} property.  If this is set to a non-zero value, then
+the object is allowed to enter the room.  This is used to provide public
+places, where anything and everything is allowed to enter.  The default
+value of this property is @code{1}.
+
+If the object has been @dfn{blessed} for entry into this room, and the
+task that is moving the object is the same as the task that requested
+the blessing, then the object is allowed to enter.  Refer to the
+@code{:bless_for_entry} verb for further details on the concept of
+blessed objects.
+
+If the owner of an object is the owner of a room, the object is allowed
+to enter.  This is a general rule used as a catch-all case.  It can be
+overridden by specifically locking against an object, but as a rule, it
+is desirable for objects owned by the room owner to be allowed to enter.
+
+Finally, if a @code{residents} list is defined in the room, and the
+object is in the list, then it is allowed to enter.  This concept can be
+used to define a set of objects that are allowed to enter the room
+without specifying a long and complex locking condition.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb num add_entrance (obj @var{entrance})
+This verb functions similarly to the @code{:add_exit} verb, but applies
+to @code{$exit} objects that lead @dfn{into} the room.  If we imagine an
+@code{$exit} object as a flexible tube connecting two rooms, then the
+concept of specifying both ends of the tube seems natural.  It is not
+usual to search the entrance list for a match, as you would with the
+exit list, but the concept of an entrance is included to cover
+unexpected cases.
+
+If it is not possible to add @var{entrance} to the room's entrance list
+(normally because the object that invoked the verb does not have the
+required permission) then the verb returns @samp{0}.  Otherwise, a successful
+addition returns @samp{1}.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none bless_for_entry (obj @var{thing})
+This verb is called by an exit to allow an object special permission to
+enter a room.  Two properties on the room store @var{thing} and the
+@code{task_id} of the calling task.  The idea behind @dfn{blessed}
+objects is to allow an object temporary permission to enter.  The
+permission is only granted if the request is made by an object that is
+an entrance into the room.
+
+The idea here is that a normally inaccessible room can be entered
+providing you use an exit that leads into the room.  In addition, the
+task ID of the task that asked for the @dfn{blessing} is stored, so that
+there is no way an object can become blessed, and then later gain entry
+to the room.  The object being blessed is only allowed to enter once per
+blessing.  Once the object has moved into the room, it's @dfn{blessed}
+status is removed by resetting the @code{blessed_object} property in the
+room to @code{$nothing}.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none @@entrances
+This verb is a player command used to list the entrances to the player's
+current location.  Only the owner of a room may list it's entrances.
+For every object kept in the room's @code{entrances} list, the exit name,
+object reference number and aliases are displayed to the player.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none go (list @var{args})
+The verb is a player command used to move from one room to another.  One
+special feature of this command is that it allows the player to string
+together a number of different movement commands into one use of the
+@samp{go} command.  This can save typing when we know where we want to
+go.  The code for this verb is shown below:
+
+@example
+for dir in (args)
+  exit = player.location:match_exit(dir);
+  if (exit < #0)
+    player:tell("Go where?");
+  else
+    exit:invoke();
+  endif
+endfor
+@end example
+
+This simply moves through the list of exits given in @var{args},
+matching the exit name in the current room, and invoking the exit if a
+valid match is found.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none look ()
+This verb is a player command used to look at various things in the
+player's current location.  It can be used meaningfully in other verbs,
+however, if the verb is called with no arguments.  In this case, it
+calls the @code{:look_self} on the room which the verb was invoked on.
+You could use this verb to print the description of a room you are not
+in, but it is stylistically better to use the @code{:look_self()} verb
+of the room.
+
+If a preposition is supplied, via this verb being invoked as a command,
+and the preposition is not @samp{on} or @samp{in}, then the verb
+attempts to match the direct object with something in the room.  If the
+match succeeds, the @code{:look_self} verb of the matched object is
+called to tell the player what the object looks like.
+
+If the preposition is @samp{on} or @samp{in}, then the player wishes to
+look inside a container of some sort, be it a member of the
+@code{$container} class, or in a player's inventory, for example.  An
+attempt is made to match the indirect object with something in the room.
+If it succeeds, then an attempt is made to match the direct object with
+something inside the container previously matched.  If this final match
+is made, the @code{:look_self} verb of the matched object is invoked to
+print it's description.
+
+If the direct object is the empty string, @samp{""}, then the
+container's @code{:look_self} verb is called to print it's description. 
+
+Any ambiguous or failed matches produce suitable error messages.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none announce_all (list @var{@@args})
+This verb is another general purpose verb used to send a message to
+every object in the room.  It is used for messages that we wish everyone
+to see, with no exceptions.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none enterfunc (obj @var{thing})
+This verb is invoked by the LambdaMOO server when an object moves into a
+room, as part of action of the @code{move} primitive.  The actions taken
+for a room are very straightforward.  If @var{thing} is a player object,
+then we tell the player where s/he has moved into using the
+@code{$room:look_self} verb on the room.  If the object is the
+@dfn{blessed_object} for this room, then the @code{blessed_object}
+property for the room is reset to @code{$nothing}.  For further details
+on @dfn{blessed objects}, refer to the description of
+@code{$room:bless_for_entry}.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none exitfunc (obj @var{thing})
+This verb is invoked by the LambdaMOO server when an object is moved out
+of a room, as part of the action of the @code{move} primitive.   The
+action defined for the @code{$room} class is to do nothing.  
+
+This verb, and the @code{:enterfunc} verb, can be used for a variety of
+effects that need to take note of objects moving in and out of rooms.
+For example, consider a @dfn{torch} object that casts light on it's
+surroundings.  When the torch is moved out of a room, the light that is
+casts moves with it.  This can be tackled using the room's
+@code{exitfunc}, which could check if the object leaving is a torch, and
+if it is, the room could become dark.   Similarly, when the torch enters
+a room, the @code{enterfunc} can be used to detect this, and brighten
+the room accordingly.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb num remove_exit (obj @var{exit})
+This verb performs the opposite function to the @code{:add_exit} verb.
+It removes @var{exit} from the room's list of exits. If it is not
+possible to remove @var{exit} from the room's exit list (normally
+because the object that invoked the verb does not have the required
+permission) then the verb returns @samp{0}.  Otherwise, a successful addition
+returns @samp{1}.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb num remove_entrance (obj @var{entrance})
+This verb performs the opposite function to the @code{:add_entrance} verb.
+It removes @var{entrance} from the room's list of entrances. If it is not
+possible to remove @var{entrance} from the room's entrance list (normally
+because the object that invoked the verb does not have the required
+permission) then the verb returns @samp{0}.  Otherwise, a successful addition
+returns @samp{1}.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none @@add-exit
+This is a player command used to add an exit to the current room.  This
+is normally used when someone else has created an exit they want to lead
+out of a room you own.  The verb matches the direct object string with
+an object in the room to get the object reference number for the exit.
+If the object found is not a descendant of the @code{$exit} object, the
+verb is aborted with an error.
+
+Otherwise, if the destination of the exit is readable and leads to a
+valid room, an attempt is made to add the exit using the room's
+@code{:add_exit} verb.  If this fails, a suitable error message is sent
+to the user.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none @@add-entrance
+This is a player command used to add an entrance to the current room.
+This follows much the same sequence as for the @samp{@@add-exit}.  An
+attempt is made to match the direct object supplied with an object in the
+room.  If this fails, the verb is aborted with a suitable error message.
+
+Otherwise, if the object found is a descendant of the @code{$exit}
+class, then the exit is checked to make sure it goes to this room.  If
+this is the case, then the exit is added as an entrance using the room's
+@code{:add-entrance} verb.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none recycle ()
+This verb is called by the LambdaMOO server when a room is recycled.
+When a room is recycled, something has to be done with the room's
+contents, both players and objects, to stop them ending up in
+@code{$nothing}.   This is done by trying to move everything @dfn{home}.
+The code to do this is shown below:
+
+@example
+for x in (this.contents)
+  if (is_player(x))
+    if (typeof(x.home) == OBJ && valid(x.home))
+      x:moveto(x.home);
+    endif
+    if (x.location == this)
+      move(x, $player_start);
+    endif
+  elseif (valid(x.owner))
+    x:moveto(x.owner);
+  endif
+endfor
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+The main loop goes through the complete contents list of the room.  If
+the object is a player, then it is moved home, using it's @code{:moveto}
+verb, or to the @code{$player_start} room, using the @code{move()}
+primitive.  All other objects are moved to the inventories of their
+owners.
+
+Note that if the attempt to move an object fails, then no action is
+taken.  The server will place all objects still in the room into
+@code{$nothing} when the room is recycled.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none @@lastlog ()
+@deftypefnx Commabd none @@lastlog (@var{player})
+This verb is a player command used to list the times that players last
+connected to the MOO.  If @var{player} is supplied, by invoking the verb
+as a command, only the last connect time for that player is shown.
+
+If no argument is supplied, the verb uses the @code{players()} primitive
+to return a list of all players in the database.  It then looks at each
+players @code{last_connect_time} property, and places a particular list,
+depending on whether the player conncted within the last day, week or
+month or longer.
+
+When all players have been placed in one or other of the lists, they
+are printed out, along with the exact connect time as found in the
+player's @code{last_connect_time} property.

+
+@deftypefn Verb none n*orth/e*east/w*west/s*south ()
+@deftypefnx Verb none northwest/northeast/southwest/southeast ()
+@deftypefnx Verb none up/down ()
+In general, when a player wants to move out of a room using an exit,
+the recognition of the exit name is done by the @code{:huh} and
+@code{:huh2} verbs for the room.  However, to cope with the most common
+cases, verbs are defined for each of the compass directions and
+@code{up} and @code{down}.  The code for these verbs is the same, and is
+shown below as an example:
+
+@example
+exit = this:match_exit(verb);
+if (valid(exit))
+  exit:invoke();
+elseif (exit == $failed_match)
+  player:tell("You can't go that way.");
+else
+  player:tell("I don't know which '", verb, "' you mean.");
+endif
+@end example
+
+What this does is check to see if the exit is defined for the room.  If
+it is, then the exit is @code{:invoke}d.  If not, a suitable message is
+sent to the player.
+
+This case is included simply to speed up processing for certain common
+cases.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none explain_syntax (string @code{verb})
+This verb is used to provide helpful information to the player should
+s/he fail to enter a command correctly.  It is called by the
+@code{:huh2} verb as a last resort to process the player command.  The
+verb follows the parser's search path for verbs looking for a match with
+@var{verb}.  If one is found, this means that the parser rejected the
+match because the argument's did not match.  
+
+Having established this, @code{:explain_syntax} compares the user input
+to the verb argument definition, and prints some explanatory text to try
+and help the player enter a correct command.  This verb usually catches
+mistakes such as entering the wrong preposition, or forgetting to use an
+indirect object.  It is provided as part of the @code{$room} class to
+allow other room subclasses to provide more specific help for certain
+verbs defined in their rooms, if the user should make an error trying to
+use one of them.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none huh2 (list @var{args})
+This verb is called by the @code{huh} verb to handle commands that the
+parser couldn't sensibly pass to another object.  In the case of a room,
+the verb covers a number of different possibilities.  First, the
+sentence is checked to see if it matches any of the exits that lead out
+of the room.  This is done using the @code{match_exit} verb.  If a
+matching exit is found then the @code{:invoke} verb for the exit is
+called, which causes it to be activated.  This provides for a flexible
+approach to handling exits.
+
+If this does not produce a sensible match, then the verb is treated in
+one of two ways.  If it starts with an `at' (@@) character, then we
+attempt to match the remainder of the verb in the sentence with a
+message field on the direct object.  A message field is a property whose
+name ends in @code{"_msg"}. If a match is found, then this is treated as
+a field setting command.  This approach is used to avoid having to
+define a verb for every message field that can exist on an object.  It
+also allows players to add extra message fields to objects simply by
+ending the name of the property with @code{"_msg"}.  For example, if you
+define a message on an object called @code{foobar_msg} then you can set
+the message with the command
+
+@example
+@@foobar <object> is <message text>
+@end example
+
+If the verb does not start with an `at' (@@) character, then we call the
+@code{:explain_syntax} verb.  This tries to match the verb with a verb
+defined on the player, room, direct object (if any) and indirect object
+(if any).  If a match is found, the syntax of the verb (ie, number and
+type of arguments and prepositions) is checked, and a useful message
+sent to the player.
+
+This approach is taken to provide flexibility.  By not placing this sort
+of code within the server, the LambdaMOO administrator has the choice of
+changing the way erroneous commands are handled.  One application could
+be an augmentation of the basic @code{huh} action to log failed commands
+in a list somewhere.  This mechanism, long used in other MUDs, can
+provide a builder with an idea of what other players have tried (and
+failed) to do in his or her areas.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none @@eject @var{object}
+This verb is a player command used to remove unwanted objects from
+places that you own.  It can be used to remove objects, which are sent
+to @code{$nothing} and players, which are sent to @code{$player_start}. 
+
+The verb first matches the supplied @var{object} with something in the
+room.  If a match is found, and the player controls the current room,
+then the ejection messages are printed, and the victim's @code{:eject}
+verb is invoked to actually remove the object.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb string ejection_msg ()
+@deftypefnx Verb string oejection_msg ()
+@deftypefnx Verb string victim_ejection_msg ()
+These three verbs return the messages used by the @code{@@eject} mechanism.
+The code for the verb is shown below, as it illustrates how to deal with
+multiple messages with a single verb:
+
+@example
+set_task_perms(caller_perms());
+return $string_utils:pronoun_sub(this.(verb));
+@end example
+
+Note the permission setting at the start of the verb.  This is necessary
+because the verb is owned by the Wizard, and hence would have permission
+to read the ejection messages on any object.  By restricting the
+permissions of the verb to those of the verb that called it, this verb
+restricts who may access the ejection messages on objects.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@noindent
+The following properties are defined for the @code{$room} class:
+
+@defvr Property victim_ejection_msg
+This is a string containing the message sent to objects that are
+ejected from a room by the owner.  It is sent to the victim by the
+room's @code{:@@eject} verb.
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property ejection_msg
+This is a string containing the message sent to the owner when
+they eject an object from the room.  It is printed by the room's
+@code{:@@eject} verb.
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property oejection_msg
+This is a string containing the message sent to everyone else in a room
+when the owner ejects an object.  It is printed by the room's
+@code{:@@eject} verb.
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property residents
+This is a simple list of objects that have their homes in this room.  It
+is examined by the @code{:accept} verb on the @code{$room} class as one of
+the criteria used to determine whether an object is allowed to enter the
+room or not.  The @code{@@sethome} verb could be enhanced to include
+players as residents when their home is set to be a particular room.
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property free_entry
+If this is set to a non-zero value, then the room is considered
+@dfn{public} and any object is allowed to move in to the room.  Setting
+the value to zero will stop objects that do not meet any of the other
+acceptance criteria from entering.  Refer to the @code{$room:accept}
+verb for further details on these criteria.
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property entrances
+This is a simple list of the exits that lead @dfn{into} this room.  It
+is manipulated by the @code{$room:add_entrance} and
+@code{$room:remove_entrance}.
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property blessed_object
+This contains the object number of the object that has been
+@dfn{blessed} for entry into this room.
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property blessed_task
+This contains the task ID of the task that requested an object be
+@dfn{blessed} for entry into the room.
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property exits
+This is a simple list of the exit objects that lead out of this room.
+It is manipulated by the @code{$room:add_exit}, @code{$room:remove_exit}
+and @code{$room:match_exit} verbs.
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property dark
+If set to a non-zero value, then this property inhibits display of the
+contents of a room when the @code{$room:look_self} verb is invoked.  It
+can be used, for example, in rooms where a large number of objects are
+likely to be located, that you do not wish to see (for instance, a
+@dfn{limbo} type room, where sleeping players and lost objects reside.).
+If the @code{dark} is set to zero, then the contents of a room are
+displayed when @code{$room:look_self} is invoked.
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property ctype

+@subsection The Thing Class
+
+The @code{$thing} defines verbs and properties for objects that exist
+in the virtual world.  This class includes everything that is not a
+player, room or exit.  For example, the classes @code{$container} and
+@code{$note} are descended from the @code{$thing} class.  The two basic
+operations that can be performed on a thing are @dfn{picking it up} and
+@dfn{putting it down}.  Two verbs are defined for the @code{$thing} class
+to implement this idea.  Configurable messages are used, so that
+someone using an object of this class can set the text printed when an
+attempt is made to take an object.  No messages are available for the
+case of dropping an object.
+
+@deftypefn Verb none g*et ()
+@deftypefnx Verb none t*ake ()
+One or the other of these verbs is invoked when a player tries to take
+possession of an object i.e., pick it up.  The code involved is fairly
+straightforward.  It checks to see if the player already has the object,
+and prints a suitable message if this is the case. If not, then the
+@code{:moveto} verb on the object is invoked.  If this results in the
+object moving into the player's inventory, then the @code{take_succeeded}
+messages defined on the object are printed.  If the @code{:moveto}
+failed, then the @code{take_failed} messages for the object are printed. 
+
+This scheme allows you to add extra conditions to restrict whether a
+player can take an object or not.  For example, you may place a notion
+of @dfn{strength} onto a player, and add @dfn{weight} to objects.  If an
+object is too heavy for a player to lift, then the object cannot be
+taken by the player.  This sort of condition should be added to the
+@code{:take} verb for the object.
+@end deftypefn
+ 
+@deftypefn Verb none d*rop ()
+@deftypefnx Verb none th*row ()
+One or the other of these verbs is invoked when a player tries to place
+an object in the room s/he is currently located, i.e., when the player
+tries to drop the object.  Again, the code is fairly straightforward.
+If the object is not located on the player, then a suitable message is
+sent to the player telling him/her to check his/her pockets.  If the
+player does possess the object, and the current location @code{:accept}
+verb indicates that the room will allow the object to be dropped, the
+object @code{:moveto} verb is invoked to move the object from the
+player's inventory to the contents list of the player's location.
+Suitable messages are printed to inform the player that the action
+succeeded, and to tell other people in the room that the object has just
+been dropped.
+@end deftypefn
+ 
+@deftypefn Verb none moveto (obj @var{where})
+This verb should be used to move an @code{$thing} object from one
+location to another.  It checks to see that @var{where} is a valid
+object, and that the lock on @var{wher} permits the object to enter.  If
+this is the case, then the @code{$root_class:moveto} verb is invoked to
+actually move the object, using @code{pass(@var{where})}.
+@end deftypefn
+ 
+@deftypefn Verb string take_failed_msg ()
+@deftypefnx Verb string take_succeeded_msg ()
+@deftypefnx Verb string otake_failed_msg ()
+@deftypefnx Verb string otake_succeeded_msg ()
+@deftypefnx Verb string drop_failed_msg ()
+@deftypefnx Verb string drop_succeeded_msg ()
+@deftypefnx Verb string odrop_failed_msg ()
+@deftypefnx Verb string odrop_succeeded_msg ()
+These eight verbs are used to access the message fields used by a
+@code{$thing} object.  In each case, the value returned by the verb is a
+a version of the corresponding @code{"_msg"} property of the object,
+with standard pronoun substitutions performed.  This allows the messages
+to be more flexible than simple constant text strings.  If extra
+complexity were to be added to the messages, then these verbs should be
+overridden.
+
+The default values of these strings are shown below:
+
+@display
+@table @code
+@item drop_failed_msg
+"You can't seem to drop %t here."
+@item drop_succeeded_msg
+"You drop %t."
+@item odrop_failed_msg
+"tries to drop %t but fails!"
+@item odrop_succeeded_msg
+"drops %t."
+@item otake_succeeded_msg
+"picks up %t."
+@item otake_failed_msg
+""
+@item take_succeeded_msg
+"You take %t."
+@item take_failed_msg
+"You can't pick that up."
+@end table
+@end display
+@end deftypefn
+
+The following properties are defined for the @code{$thing} class. They
+are the messages used by the @code{$thing:take} and @code{$thing:drop}
+verbs in various situations.  All of these message can use standard
+pronoun substitutions.
+
+@defvr Property otake_succeeded_msg
+This message is the text sent to other people in the thing's location
+when the thing is taken by another object. The default value of this
+string is @samp{picks up %t.}
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property otake_failed_msg
+This message is the text sent to other people in the thing's location
+when an attempt by another object to take the thing fails. The default
+value of this string is @samp{}
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property take_succeeded_msg
+When an object successfully takes a thing, this message is sent to
+inform the object of success. The default value of this string is
+@samp{You take %t.}
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property take_failed_msg
+When an object unsuccessfully tries to take a thing, this message is
+sent to tell the object that the attempt failed. The default value of
+this string is @samp{You can't pick that up.}
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property odrop_succeeded_msg
+This message is the text sent to other people in the thing's location
+when the thing is dropped by another object. The default value of this
+string is @samp{drops %t.}
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property odrop_failed_msg
+This message is the text sent to other people in the thing's location
+when an attempt by another object to drop the thing fails.  The default
+value of this string is @samp{tries to drop %t but fails!}
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property drop_succeeded_msg
+When an object successfully drops a thing, this message is sent to
+inform the object of success.  The default value of this message is
+@samp{You drop %t.}
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property drop_failed_msg
+When an object unsuccessfully tries to drop a thing, this message is
+sent to tell the object that the attempt failed.  The default value of
+this string is @samp{You can't seem to drop %t here.}
+@end defvr
+
+@subsection The Exit Class
+
+The @code{$exit} class is the other type of object used to construct the
+fabric of the virtual world.  You can imagine an exit to be a flexible
+tube connecting two @code{$room} objects.  Each @code{$exit} object goes
+in one direction only.  It leads from a @dfn{source} object to a
+@dfn{destination} object.  Note that it takes no virtual time to
+traverse an exit.   When an object moves through an exit, it moves from
+one room to another instantaneously.  
+
+The verbs defined for the @code{$exit} class are fairly simple and
+obvious.  Several messages are defined as properties on an exit.  These
+are pronoun substituted and printed when the exit is invoked, under
+various conditions.
+
+@deftypefn Verb none invoke ()
+This verb is used to trigger an exit.  In the @code{$room} class, when a
+player elects to move through an exit, this verb is called to move the
+player through the exit.  The code for this verb is very simple.  It
+calls the exit's @code{:move} verb, with the @code{player} object as an
+argument.
+
+This is the verb to use for moving players through exits.  It does not
+allow objects to be moved.  For that, a direct call to the
+exit's @code{:move} verb is needed, with the object you wish to move
+through the exit as an argument.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none move (obj @var{thing})
+This verb is used to move @var{thing} through the exit.  It provides a
+general mechanism for moving any sort of object through the exit, not
+necessarily just players.  The code for this verb performs a number of
+actions.  First, the lock on the exit is checked to see if @var{thing}
+is allowed to use the exit.  If this is not the case, the
+@code{nogo_msg} and @code{onogo_msg} text is sent to @var{thing} and
+everyone else in @var{thing}'s location, respectively.
+
+If the object is allowed to use the exit, it is @dfn{blessed} for entry
+to the destination room.  This is done to ensure that the object will be
+accepted by the destination room.  It provides a way to stop objects
+moving into a room by any means other than an exit leading into the
+room.  By simply prohibiting all objects from entering the room, the
+only way in is then to use an exit that leads into that room.
+
+If the object is accepted by the room, determined using the
+@code{$room:accept} verb, then the @code{leave} messages are printed to
+@var{thing} and the other people in the room.  Then
+@var{thing}@code{:moveto} is invoked to move the object from the current
+room to the destination of the exit.  Once this has been done, the
+@code{arrive} messages for the exit are printed out to @var{thing} and
+the destination room's occupants.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none recycle ()
+This verb is defined to allow an exit to be tidily removed from the
+database.  The exit is removed from the @code{entrance} and @code{exit}
+lists of the destination and source rooms respectively, if the caller of
+this verb has permission to do so.  This is done using the
+@code{$room:remove@{entrance|exit@}} verbs.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none leave_msg () 
+@deftypefnx Verb none oleave_msg () 
+@deftypefnx Verb none arrive_msg () 
+@deftypefnx Verb none oarrive_msg () 
+@deftypefnx Verb none nogo_msg () 
+@deftypefnx Verb none onogo_msg
+These verbs return a pronoun substituted version of the corresponding
+properties stored on the exit object.  They are used by
+@code{$exit:move}.
+@end deftypefn
+
+The following properties are defined for the @code{$exit} class.  Most
+of them are messages used when the exit is invoked.  
+
+@defvr Property source
+This is the object that the exit leads out of.  If the exit has been
+created using the correct verbs, the exit object should be in the
+@code{exits} list of the @code{source} room object.
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property dest
+This is the object that the exit leads to.  If the exit has been created
+using the correct verbs, the exit object should be in the @code{entrances}
+list of the @code{dest} room object.
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property nogo_msg
+This is the message printed to an object if it is unable to move through
+the exit.
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property onogo_msg
+This is the message printed to everyone in an object's location if it is
+unable to move through the exit.
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property arrive_msg
+This is the message printed to an object using an exit when it arrives
+in the destination room.
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property oarrive_msg
+This is the message printed in the destination room of the exit when
+something is moved through it.
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property oleave_msg
+This is the message printed in the exit's source room when an object
+moves through the exit.
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property leave_msg
+This is the message printed to an object using the exit as it leaves the
+source room.
+@end defvr
+
+@subsection The Player Class
+
+The player class is the one of the basic classes of the virtual world.
+A player object is the same as any other object, except that has it's
+@code{player} bit set.  This allows the server to connect a user to that
+object.  A number of player commands are defined as verbs of the
+@code{$player} class, as well as other useful functions.
+
+@deftypefn Verb none g*et ()
+@deftypefnx Verb none take ()
+This verb is called in the situation when another object tries to
+@dfn{get} or @dfn{take} a player.  Given that this is a fairly
+nonsensical thing to do, it is not allowed.  Suitable messages are sent
+to the object that invoked the action, and the player object.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none i*nventory ()
+This verb is used to tell a player what s/he has in his/her pockets.
+The code for the verb provides the best documentation, so it is printed
+below.  Note the use of the @code{thing:title} verb to get the name of
+an object.
+
+@example
+if (length(player.contents))
+  player:tell("You are carrying:");
+  for thing in (player.contents)
+    player:tell(thing:title());
+  endfor
+else
+  player:tell("You are empty-handed.");
+endif
+@end example
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none wh*isper ()
+This verb is used to send secret messages between two players, as if
+they were whispering to each other.  The way this works is slightly the
+reverse of what might be expected, because the @code{:whisper} verb on
+the person being whispered to is the one that is invoked.   The message,
+referred to by the @code{dobjstr}, is printed to the recipient, with
+suitable text surrounding it to indicate that is it a whisper.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none look_self ()
+This verb overrides the @code{$root_class} definition to provide an
+indication to other players of whether this player is currently active
+or not.  It uses @code{pass()} to allow the parent class to print a
+description, and then looks at the @code{connected_players()} list to
+determine if this player is currently connected.  If not, then the text
+
+@example
+He is sleeping
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+is printed.  If the player is connected, and has been
+idle for less than 60 seconds, then the string 
+
+@example
+He is awake and looks alert
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+is printed.  If the player is connected, but has been inactive
+for more than 60 seconds, the string 
+
+@example
+He is awake, but has been staring off into space for @strong{X}
+@end example
+
+@noindent 
+is printed, where @code{X} is an indication of the time the player has
+been inactive.  The gender pronoun inserted is taken from the pronoun
+list for the player.  This means it can vary with the gender of the
+player object. 
+
+If the player is carrying any objects, a simple list of these is
+printed.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none @@gag (@var{args})
+The concept of gagging is fairly simple to understand.  If there is a
+player or object you do not wish to see any output from, then you can
+place the player or object into your @dfn{gag list}.  If any output is
+sent to you from that object, using it's @code{:tell} verb, then it is
+ignored, and not printed on your terminal screen.
+
+Two gaglists are maintained: one for players, in the property
+@code{gaglist} and one for objects, in the property
+@code{object_gaglist}.
+
+Three verbs are used to maintain and observe the list of objects that
+are in the gag lists.  The @code{@@gag} verb is used as a player command
+to add objects to the gag lists.  The code for this is fairly
+straightforward, and is included below:
+
+@example
+if (player != this)
+  player:tell("Permission denied.");
+  return;
+endif
+victims = $string_utils:match_player(args);
+if (!victims)
+  player:tell("Usage:  @@gag <player or object> 
+                    [<player or object>...]");
+  return;
+endif
+gagplayers = gagobjs = @{@};
+for i in [1..length(args)]
+  if (valid(victims[i]))
+    gagplayers = @{victims[i], @@gagplayers@};
+  elseif (valid(o = player.location:match(args[i])))
+    gagobjs = @{o, @@gagobjs@};
+  elseif (tonum(o = toobj(args[i])) && valid(o))
+    gagobjs = @{o, @@gagobjs@};
+  else
+    player:tell("Could not find ", args[i], " as either a player or an object.");
+  endif
+endfor
+changed = 0;
+for p in (gagplayers)
+  if (p in player.gaglist)
+    player:tell("You are already gagging ", p.name, ".");
+  else
+    changed = 1;
+    player.gaglist = setadd(this.gaglist, p);
+  endif
+endfor
+for o in (gagobjs)
+  if (o in player.object_gaglist)
+    player:tell("You are already gagging ", o.name, ".");
+  else
+    changed = 1;
+    player.object_gaglist = setadd(this.object_gaglist, o);
+  endif
+endfor
+if (changed)
+  fork (0)
+    this:("@@listgag")();
+  endfork
+endif
+@end example
+
+Note that you can only manipulate your own gag list.  Other objects
+cannot change your gag list.  Another interesting point is the call to
+@code{@@listgag}, after the new objects have been added to the gag
+list, to print the current gag list.
+
+The code first tries to match the argument list against the players in
+the database, using @code{$string_utils:match_player()}.  Then, for each
+argument given, if a match was not found using that method, a match for
+an object in the room is tried, using the utility routine
+@code{$string_utils:match_object()}.  If this fails, the argument is
+rejected.
+
+This results in a list of objects to be added to the player's gag lists.
+Any objects already in the player's gag lists are removed from the
+@dfn{to do} list.  If this yields an empty @dfn{to do} list, the command
+is aborted.  Any objects that are not already in the gag list are added
+to it.
+
+Finally, @code{this:@@listgag} is called to print the list, if it has
+changed. 
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none @@listgag ()
+This verb is used as a player command to list the objects in the
+player's gag lists.  If the gag lists are not empty, a list of the names
+of the players in the @code{gaglist} property on the player, and the
+objects in the @code{object_gaglist} property are produced.
+
+The verb uses a test based on the @code{callers()} primitive, to
+determine if it is being called by another verb, or invoked by a player
+as a command.  If @code{callers()} returns a null list (and hence is not
+@code{TRUE}, then the verb is being invoked as a player command.  This
+affects the text printed by the verb.
+
+In addition, the verb checks through the gag lists of all the player's
+in the database, to see if the player who invoked the command is listed
+in anyone else's gag list.  If this is the case, a list of the people
+doing the gagging is printed.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none @@ungag (@var{args})
+This verb is used as a player command to remove an object from one
+of the player's gag lists, if it is a member.  The @code{dobjstr} is
+used as the name of the thing to remove from the gag list.
+
+If this name is @samp{everyone} then the player gag and object
+gag lists are reset to the empty list.  Otherwise, if a valid direct
+object has been referred to, by checking @code{dobj}, that is used as
+the object to gag.  Otherwise, an attempt is made to match the
+@code{dobjstr} with something in the player gag list.  If no match is
+found, it is retried with the object gag list.  If this fails, the
+command is aborted with an error message.
+
+If a valid match is found, it is removed from the relevant list, and the
+player informed. @code{@@listgag} is used to print the list after the
+operation has been completed.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none news ()
+This is a very simple verb used as a player command to print out the
+current MOO news.  It makes a simple call to the verb @code{$news:read}
+to actually perform the reading task.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none @@gripe (@var{args})
+A @dfn{gripe} is a player complaint or observation that is sent, using
+MOO mail, to all the administrators in the game.  It is intended to
+provide a way to report problems with the MOO in a high-priority way
+that will attract the attention of the people who can do something about
+it.  A good example of the use of a gripe is to complain about a bug in
+one of the core classes, or maybe even a request for something to be
+added. 
+
+The implementation of the gripe concept involves a property on the
+@dfn{System Object} called @code{$gripe_recipients}.  This is a list of
+all the players who will be mailed the @code{@@gripe} message.  When a
+player types in @code{@@gripe} they are taken to the mail room to enter
+their message.  Any text entered on the line with the @code{@@gripe}
+command is taken to be the subject of the gripe message.  When the
+message is finished and sent, it is received by all the people on the
+@code{$gripe_recipients} list.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none gi*ve ()
+@deftypefnx Verb none ha*nd ()
+This verb is a player command used to exchange objects between players.
+It performs a @code{:moveto} on the direct object to the inventory of
+the indirect object.  If, after the move, the object is still in the
+possession of the donor, then it is obvious that the recipient has
+rejected the gift.  If this is the case, a suitable message is printed
+to the doner.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none ? help info*rmation ()
+This verb is a player command used to activate the help system.  It is
+described more fully in the section on the help system.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none @@password ()
+This verb is a player command used to change a player's password.  A
+player's password is stored in a property on the player called,
+surprisingly enough,  @code{password}.  The @code{crypt()} primitive is
+used to store the password in encrypted form, using the standard UN*X
+encryption algorithm.  Note that you need to know your old password in
+order to change it, unless a password has not been previously set for
+this player.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none @@gender (string @var{gender})
+This verb is used to set the gender of a player object.  Without any
+arguments, it prints the player's gender, currently set pronouns and the
+available genders stored on @code{$gender_utils.genders}.
+
+If a gender is given as the argument, @var{gender}, then the
+@code{$gender_utils:set} verb is called to actually change the player's
+gender pronouns.  If this verb does not return an error, then the gender
+of the player is set to the full gender name which is returned.
+@code{$gender_utils:set} takes care of setting the correct pronouns.
+
+If an error is returned when trying to set the player's gender, this
+could indicate that permission to change the pronouns was denied, or
+some other problem existed.  If a value of @code{E_NONE} is returned by
+@code{$gender_utils:set} then the gender of the player is set, but the
+pronouns are left unchanged.
+
+The gender of a player is used in the @code{string_utils:pronoun_sub}
+verb to insert the appropriate pronouns in places where @samp{%}
+substitutions have been used.  When the gender of a player is changed,
+it results in a set of 8 properties being assigned on the player, one
+for every type of possible pronoun substitution.  A further property,
+containing the gender of the player, is also set, for example, to either
+"male", "female", or "neuter", depending on the argument given to the
+@code{@@gender} command.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none page (list @var{args})
+This verb is a player command used to send messages between players who
+are not physically located in the same room in the virtual world.  You
+can imagine a @dfn{page} to be a worldwide form of whispering.  Without an
+argument, a message like
+
+@example
+You sense that blip is looking for you in The Venue Hallway.
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+is sent to the recipient of the page.  If an argument is given, it is
+treated as a message to send to the other player.  This results in the
+recipient getting a message like
+
+@example
+You sense that blip is looking for you in Hallway.
+He pages, "Hello - are you busy ?"
+@end example
+
+Paging is used primarily to attract the attention of a player, or to
+pass short messages between players in different locations.  It is not
+intended to be used for conversation.
+
+If a player name has been given as an argument, the @code{:page} verb
+first tries to match the first argument with a player name, using
+@code{$string_utils:match_player}.  If a match is found, then there are
+two possibilities.  Firstly, if the player is not connected, a pronoun
+substituted version of the string returned by that player's
+@code{:page_absent_msg} verb is printed to the sender, and the verb is
+aborted.
+
+Otherwise, if the recipient is connected, we send him/her the string
+returned by the sender's @code{:page_origin_msg}.  We then check to see
+if, optonally, @samp{with} followed by a message is part of the argument
+list for the verb.  If so, then the message is extracted from the
+argument list and sent to the recipient, suitably pronoun substituted. 
+The string returned by the recipient's @code{:page_echo_msg} verb is
+printed to the sending player.
+
+An interesting piece of coding is used to stop the line containing the
+message from duplicating the sender's name if it has already been sent
+as part of the @code{:page_origin_msg}.  For example, if blip page's
+Ezeke, Ezeke might see the following:
+
+@example
+You sense that blip is looking for you in The Venue Hallway
+He pages, "Hello"
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+which would be better than something like
+
+@example
+You sense that blip is looking for you in The Venue Hallway
+blip pages, "Hello"
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+The code in question is shown below:
+

+This verb is a player command used to change the name and aliases of an

+and then the verb name.  If both are found, the indirect object string
+is used to set verb name.
+
+If the direct object string cannot be parsed as a verb, then a match is
+attempted using the string as an object name.  If this succeeds, then

+
+If the @dfn{paranoid level} of the recipient is @samp{2}, this means
+that they wish to see who has sent them a message.  The
+@code{$player:whodunnit} verb returns the object reference of the player

+then printed to the player.
+
+If the @dfn{paranoid level} of the recipient is @samp{1}, then the

+or is in the list @var{mistrust}.  The verb is used by
+@code{$player:tell} to locate the originator of a message.  It returns a

+@deftypefn Verb none home ()
+This verb is normally invoked by the player as a command.  The
+@dfn{home} of a player is the room where s/he goes to when they
+disconnect.  Unlike some flavours of MUD, MOO does not cause you
+to lose all your possessions if you go home.
+
+The @code{:home} verb performs a simple sequence.  It first checks
+whether the player is already at home, and tells him/her so if this is
+the case.  Secondly, a check is made that the player's home (stored in
+the @code{home} property on the player, is a valid object.  If this is
+not the case, the verb sets the home to the default,
+@code{$player_start}, and stops with a suitable message.
+
+Having decided that the player has a valid home s/he is not already in,
+the verb uses @code{$player:moveto} to send the player to the home
+location.  If this doesn't work - checked by comparing the player's home
+with the player's location after the move - then for some reason the
+player's home location has not allowed him/her to enter.  A suitable
+message is printed, and no further action is taken.

+This verb is a player command used to set the player's @dfn{home} to be

+@code{:accept} verb..  This allows builders to restrict which rooms may
+be used by players as their homes.  If the room does not allow the
+player to set it as his/her home, a suitable message is printed to

+This verb is called when the player connects to the LambdaMOO server.

+@code{~/.cshrc} or @code{~/.kshrc} file that is activated when you log
+into a UN*X account. The verb defined for the player class is listed

+
+This performs a couple of actions.  First it calls @code{$news:check} to
+see whether the news has been updated since this player last looked at
+it.  Then it checks through the MOO Mail list on the player to see if any
+mail has arrived since they were last connected.
+
+You could place a variety of actions into this verb.  For example, you
+may wish to tell your friends when you log in, by sending a suitable
+message to them if they are connected.  Similarly, you may wish to
+produce a special message in the room you are in when you connect.

+This is a player command used to create a room or exit, (that is,
+instances of the class @code{$room} or @samp{$exit}.  The verb parses
+the arguments to determine the type and number of objects that are to be
+created.  It uses the @code{create()} primitive, with @code{$room} as a
+parent to create a room.   Note that you can only use the @code{@@dig}
+command to dig an exit from within a room.  The
+@code{building_utils:make_exit} verb is called to dig an exit.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none @@cl*asses ()
+This is a player command used to list the publicly available classes
+in the database.  The public classes are divided into different
+sections, as defined by the property @code{$class_registry}.  This
+contains a list of entries, in the following form:
+
+@example
+@{ @{@var{name}, @var{description}, @var{members}@}, @dots{} @}
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+where @var{name} is the name of the superclass of objects,
+@var{description} is a short, one line description of the superclass,
+and @var{members} is a list of object references that are in the
+superclass.
+
+If no argument is given to the @samp{@@classes} command, it runs through
+the entries in the @code{$class_registry} and prints out the name and
+description.
+
+If an argument is given, it is taken as one or more names of an entries in the
+@code{$class_registry}.    The names of the @var{members} of the
+requested classes are printed, in this case, using @code{this:classes_2}.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none classes_2 (obj @var{root}, @var{indent}, list @var{members}, list @var{printed})
+This verb is called by @samp{@@classes} to print the members of the
+classes given in @var{members}.  It is called recursively to list all
+the children of every class in @var{members}.  If @var{root} is in the
+list of @var{members} then it is printed as the class root name.
+Otherwise, it is printed as a member of the class.  For every child of
+the @var{root}, if it is in the set @var{printed}, @code{this:classes_2}
+is called, to print any descendants.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb str who_location_msg ()
+@deftypefnx Verb str whereis_location_msg ()
+@deftypefnx Verb str page_origin_msg ()
+@deftypefnx Verb str page_echo_msg ()
+@deftypefnx Verb str page_absent_msg ()
+These verbs return the value of the corresponding property on the player
+after pronoun substitution.  They are provided to allow the player to
+override the verbs for more distinctive and complex messages.
+@end deftypefn
+
+The following properties are defined for the @code{$player} class.
+
+@defvr Property current_message
+This property contains an integer index into the list of MOO Mail
+messages currently stored in the @code{messages} property.  It is used
+by the mail handler to determine which message the player is currently
+looking at.
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property messages
+This property contains a list of mail messages.  Each mail message is a
+list in the following format:
+
+@example
+@{@var{num}, @{@var{line-1}, @var{line-2}, @dots{}, @var{line-n}@}@}
+@end example
+
+@var{num} gives the message number used in the various MOO mail
+commands.  The list of strings contains the text of the message, one
+line per string.
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property last_connect_time
+This property is an integer, holding the time that this player last

+with the value of this property.
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property home
+This property stores the object number of the player's @dfn{home}.  This
+is the place that the player is taken to when s/he types in @samp{home}.
+The home room is normally either a general sleeping area, or the player's hotel
+room or apartment.
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property password
+This property stores the encrypted password used to connect to the
+LambdaMOO server as this player.  It is changed by using the
+@samp{@@password} command, and is checked by the server upon login.
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property gaglist
+This property stores a list of object numbers.  Any output received,
+using @code{$player:tell} from any of the objects in the list is
+filtered out of the text sent to the player's terminal screen.  Items
+are added and deleted to this list using the @samp{@@gag} and
+@samp{@@ungag} commands.
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property paranoid
+This property is an integer, representing the @dfn{paranoid level} of
+the player.  If set to @samp{2}, any output received by the player, via
+@code{$player:tell} is prefixed with the name of the object that
+originated the message.  This is used to that a player can detect spoof
+output from other players or objects.
+
+If set to @samp{1}, any messages sent using @code{$player:tell} are
+stored in a small cache in the property @code{responsible}, along with
+details of where the message came from.  This can be used for later
+checking with the @samp{@@check} command.
+
+If set to @samp{0}, no spoof checking is performed.  This is the normal
+case. 
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property responsible
+This property stores a list in the following format:
+
+@example
+@{@var{callers}, @var{text}@}
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+The @var{callers} part is in the same format returned by the
+@code{callers()} primitive, and lists the @dfn{verb stack} at the time
+that the message stored in @var{text} was sent.
+
+This property is set by @code{$player:tell} and looked at by
+@code{$player:@@check}.  It contains a maximum number of entries, as
+determined by the value of the @code{lines} property on the player.
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property lines
+This property stores the number of lines kept in the property
+@code{responsible} for anti-spoof checking.
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property object_gaglist
+This property holds a list of objects that are in the player's
+@dfn{gaglist}.  Any output from these objects is ignored by the player's
+@code{:tell} verb.
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property page_absent_msg
+This property holds the message sent to someone when they try to page
+the player while s/he is not connected.   It may contain the usual
+pronoun substitutions.  The default value is @samp{%n is not currently
+logged in.}
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property page_origin_msg
+This property holds the message sent to a player you page, telling them
+where you are.  The default message is @samp{You sense that %n is
+looking for you in %l.}
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property page_echo_msg
+This property holds the message sent to a player that pages you when you
+are logged in.  The default message is @samp{Your message has been
+sent.}
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property whereis_location_msg
+This property holds the message sent when someone locates you through
+the @samp{@@whereis} command.  The default message is @samp{%N (%#) is
+in %l (%[#l]).}  This might expand out to something like
+
+@example
+Blip (#35) is in The Toilet (#96).
+@end example
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property who_location_msg
+This property holds the message printed in a @dfn{who list} to inform
+other player's of your location.  The default value is @samp{%l}, which
+returns your current location.
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property mail_notify

+@defvrx Property mail_forward
+These properties define your MOO mail environment.  They are discussed
+in more detail in the section on the MOO Mail system.
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property edit_options
+This property defines your MOO editor environment.  It is discussed in
+more detail in the section on the MOO editor.
+@end defvr
+
+@section The Mail Room Class
+
+*** To be updated for MOO 1.3 ***
+
+This class provides the mail facility used within LambdaMOO. Some would
+say that to provide an electronic mail facility within a game is
+slightly insane, but it is very useful for passing around game related
+messages.  Coupled with the use of a suitable client program, for
+example the excellent @code{mud.el} with MOO Mail extensions, sending MOO
+mail can be easy and efficient.  It also allows players to separate
+their MOO based mail from other, more important mail.
+
+LambdaMOO does not yet provide any facility for reading input from a
+player.  For this reason, programs such as the mail room use a
+pseudo-room to catch player input.  For example, when you start to
+compose a mail message, you are transported to the mail pseudo-room.
+Once there, anything you enter is trapped by various verbs in the room,
+and stored in the message you are entering.
+
+This method means that commands used in the mail composition
+environment are actually verbs on the mail pseudo-room.
+
+Mail messages are actually stored on the player object, in a property
+list called @code{messages}.  Each message occupies one entry, called a
+@dfn{mail record}, in the following format:
+
+@example
+@{@var{num}, @{@var{date}, @var{from}, @var{to}, @var{subject}, @var{line1}, @dots{}, @var{lineN}@} @}
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+Apart from the @var{num} field, these are all strings.  The @var{num}
+field stores the message number for each message.  When a new piece of
+mail arrives, it is allocated a message number 1 greater than the last
+message in the player's mailbox.  If the mailbox is empty, the message
+is numbered @samp{1}.  Each message retains it's unique message number
+until it is deleted using @samp{@@rmmail}.
+
+The number of messages in the mailbox is given by the length of the
+messages list.  A @dfn{current message} pointer is maintained in the
+property @code{$player.current_message}.  This is used to determine
+which message to print when the @samp{@@read} command is used.
+
+The MOO Mail system is implemented by four separate objects, and some
+verbs on the @code{$player} class:
+
+@itemize @bullet
+@item
+The Mail Room/Editor @code{($mail_room or $mail_editor)}.  This room
+is the place where mail messages are composed.  It also contains a
+number of mail utility verbs.  The mail editor is a child of the
+@code{Generic Editor}.
+@item
+The Mail Distribution Center @code{($mail_agent)}.  This is a child of
+@code{$root_class} and has verbs used to handle mail distribution.  It
+is also the database of @dfn{mailing lists} and @dfn{mail folders}.
+@item The Generic Mail Recipient @code{($mail_recipient)}. This is a special
+class used to set up @dfn{mailing lists} and @dfn{folders}.
+@item
+The Player Class @code{($player)}.  This class holds various player
+commands used to deal with the MOO Mail system.
+@end itemize
+
+The sections that follow detail the verbs in each of the classes, along
+with any relevant properties.
+
+@subsection Mail Commands and Properties on The Player Class
+A number of verbs are defined in the @code{$player} class to provide
+access to the mail system.  These verbs are detailed below:
+ 
+@deftypefn Verb none @@mail (@var{args})
+This command is used to list the messages currently stored in the
+player's mailbox.   Mail messages are stored in the property list
+@code{messages} on the player.  This is a list of complete messages,
+stored one per list item, in the format shown above.  
+
+The @samp{@@mail} command first checks the current message number still
+exists, using the verb @code{this:fix_current_message}.  It then
+attempts to parse the arguments given to it, to get a set of message
+numbers that the user wishes to have displayed.  The possible arguments
+are as follows :-
+
+@display
+@table @code
+@item cur
+- the current message
+@item new
+- all messages after the current message
+@item @var{num}
+- (where @var{num} is a number) the message numbered @var{num} if there is one.
+@item @var{num1}-@var{num2}
+- all messages in the given range, if any.
+@item last:@var{num}
+- the last @var{num} messages
+@item -@var{num}
+- the last @var{num} messages
+@end table
+@end display
+
+These may be combined on the @samp{@@mail} command line.  When a list of
+messages to display has been gathered in the variable @code{msglist},
+the following code is used to display the list to the user:
+
+@example
+for x in (msglist)
+  msg_num = x[1];
+  player:tell(this.current_message == msg_num ? "-> " | "   ", 
+              $string_utils:right(msg_num, 2), ":  ", 
+	      $mail_recipient:summary_line(x[2]));
+endfor
+@end example
+
+For example,
+@example
+You have 3 messages:
+    1:  May 30 12:18   Ezeke (#57)   Classes Documentation
+    2:  Jun  4 19:35   Ezeke (#57)   Room contents using title()
+->  3:  Jun  5 10:23   Ezeke (#57)   Potential problems
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+The pointer, @samp{->} indicates the current message.  The date, subject
+and sender of each message, along with the message number, is taken from
+the relevant mail record stored in the player's @code{messages} property.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none @@rmm*ail (@var{args})
+This command is used to delete mail from the player's mailbox property,
+@code{messages}.  The verb takes each message number given as an
+argument, and searches for the message in the player's mailbox.  If an
+argument is the string @samp{cur}, then this is taken as the number of
+the current message.
+
+If a match is found, by checking the first entry in each @dfn{mail
+record}, the message is removed from the @code{messages} property list.
+If a message is not found, the player is informed with a suitable
+message.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none @@send @var{player1} @var{player2} @dots{}
+This command is used to send mail messages to other players.  The verb
+simply calls 
+
+@example
+$mail_editor:invoke(args, verb, this.mail_options)
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+to start composition of a message. 
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none @@read
+@deftypefnx Verb none @@read @var{num1} @var{num2} @dots{}
+This command is used to read mail messages in the player's mailbox.  If
+no argument is given, the @dfn{current message} is displayed on the
+player's terminal screen.  If a list of one or more message numbers is
+given, each message is printed out, in turn.  
+
+The verb first checks to see if an argument has been given.  If this is
+not the case, it attempts to get the current message number, and use
+this as the argument.  If there are no messages, or no possible current
+message, the verb is aborted with a warning message to the player.
+
+Once the message number(s) to display has been decided,  a loop is
+entered which lists each message in turn.  For each message number given
+the mailbox is searched for the message with that number.   If no
+message is found with a given number, a warning message is sent to the
+user.
+
+Printing a message simply involves printing the message number, and the
+message text - the second item in the mail record.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none @@answer
+@deftypefnx Verb none @@answer @var{msg}
+@deftypefnx Verb none @@reply
+@deftypefnx Verb none @@reply @var{msg}
+This command is used to reply to a message sent by another player.  If
+no argument is given, the current message number (if valid) is taken to
+be the message to reply to.  Once a valid message has been located in
+the player's @code{messages} property, the verb
+
+@example
+$mail_editor:invoke(2, verb, x[2], @{@@this.mail_options, @@args@});
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+is invoked to allow the player to compose a reply, where @var{x} is the
+message being replied to.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb num receive_message (list @var{message})
+This function is called by other mail system verbs to place a message in
+the player's mailbox property, @code{messages}.  If the calling verb has
+permission to modify the properties on the player, the message is simply
+added to the end of the current list of messages, and given a message
+number one greater than the maximum current message number.
+
+A notification is sent to the player, informing him/her that new mail
+has arrived.  The verb returns @samp{1} for a successful delivery, and
+an error code (normally @code{E_PERM}) otherwise.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none fix_current_message ()
+This verb is used to validate the @dfn{current message} number property
+on the player.  For example, if a player deletes the current message,
+then the number stored in the @code{current_message} property no longer
+points to a valid message.  This verb checks through all the messages in
+the mailbox, @code{player.messages}, until it finds message number
+@code{current_message}, or it passes the place in the list where the
+current message is supposed to be.  If this happens, the current message
+property is set to the next message along in the list.  If this does not
+produce a valid message number, then the current message is taken to be
+the last message on the list, or @samp{0} if there are no more messages.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none @@next ()
+This command is used to advance the current message pointer to the next
+message in the player's mailbox.  This is done by incrementing the
+pointer, and then calling @var{$player:fix_current_message} to validate
+it.  If there is no message after the current message, the pointer is
+moved off the list.
+
+Once a new current message has been found, it is printed out using the
+@code{$player:@@read} verb.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none @@prev ()
+This command is used to backtrack the current message pointer to the
+previous message in the player's mailbox.  This is done by looking for
+the current message in the message list, and then decrementing the index
+that expression returns by one place.
+
+Once a new current message has been found, it is printed out using the
+@code{$player:@@read} verb.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none @@renumber ()
+This verb is used to renumber the messages in a player's mailbox to all
+consecutive numbers, starting from one.  After checking that the person
+invoking the verb has permission to perform the renumbering, and there
+are messages to renumber, the verb executes the following code:
+
+@example
+newmsgs = @{@};
+i = 0;
+for x in (this.messages)
+  newmsgs = @{@@newmsgs, @{i = i + 1, x[2]@}@};
+endfor
+this.messages = newmsgs;
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+which is fairly self explanatory. The current message number is
+preserved by getting it's index in the list of messages.  This is the
+number that the message will have after the renumbering operation.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@subsection The Mail Room or Mail Editor
+When a player wishes to send a mail message, s/he is transported to the
+mail room to compose the message.  This room is a child of the generic
+editor, and provides all the functions documented in the section on that
+class.  In addition, it provides verbs and properties related
+specifically to the sending of mail messages.  The following section
+describes each of the @code{$mail_room} verbs and properties in detail.
+
+@deftypefn Verb string working_on (num @var{who})
+This verb returns a string describing the mail message currently being
+worked on by the player identified by @var{who}.  It executes the
+following code:
+
+@example
+return this:ok(who = args[1]) && "a letter to " + 
+               this:recipient_names(who) + 
+               ((subject = this.subjects[who]) && 
+               " entitled \"" + subject + "\"");
+@end example
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb list parse_invoke (@var{args})
+This verb parses the arguments given to @code{$mail_room:invoke} to
+determine the type of mail editor invocation required - either produced
+by an @samp{@@answer} or a @samp{@@send} command.  In the latter case,
+the arguments passed to @code{$mail_room:invoke} are
+
+@example
+invoke(@var{rcpts}, @var{verb}, @var{flags} [, @var{subject}])
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+The argument @var{rcpts} is a list of recipients for the message.  This
+list is parsed using the verb @code{$mail_room:parse_recipients()}.
+The @var{flags} parameter is a list of possible mail options.  In this
+case, it is searched for the @code{replyto} option, and a variable set
+if it is found.  The parameter @var{subject} can optionally give the
+subject for the message.  For an @samp{@@send} command, the returned
+list from this verb contains the following information:
+
+@example
+@{list @var{rcpts}, str @var{subject}, str @var{replyto}, @{@}@}
+@end example
+
+For an @code{@@answer} command, the arguments are
+
+@example
+invoke(2, @var{verb}, @var{msg}, @var{flags})
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+For answering a message, a different set of information is given and
+returned.  The verb @code{$mail_editor:parse_msg_headers} is used to
+parse the options given by the player into a variable @var{hdrs}.
+
+Several options can be specified in this way to the @samp{@@answer}
+command. as shown below.
+
+@display
+@table @code
+@item incl
+- include the original message text.
+@item all
+- reply to everyone in the mail header.
+@item sender
+- reply to the sender only.
+@item noincl
+- do not include the original message in your reply.
+@end table
+@end display
+
+If the @samp{incl} option is given, the original message text is placed
+into a variable @var{incl} for returned to the calling verb.  Every line
+is prepended with the characters @var{ >}, as one would expect.
+
+The list shown below is returned to the calling verb:
+
+@example
+@{@var{hdrs}, @var{include}@}
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+where @var{hdrs} is the list returned by parsing @var{msg} supplied to
+the verb, and @var{include} contains any included message text.
+
+If any problem is encountered in parsing the message headers, or in
+recognising which command originated the call to this verb, @samp{0} is
+returned.

+@defvr Property recipients ()
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property subjects ()
+@end defvr
+
+
+@deftypefn Verb num accept (obj @var{thing})
+This verb overrides the @code{$room} class definition.  In this case,
+@var{thing} is allowed to enter the room only if it is in the list
+@code{$mail_room:writers}.  In practice, this stops anyone from moving
+into the room, unless they have used a mail system command that enters
+their object number into the list of @dfn{message writers}.  This is
+necessary because the action of entering the room causes certain mail
+related state to be setup.  
+
+Note that the normal way to enter the mail room is to use the
+@samp{@@send}, for example.  When a player enters the room using one of
+the mail commands, s/he is added to the list of writers.  If, for some
+reason, the player has to @samp{@@move} out of the room, then s/he can
+move back in using @samp{@@move} because s/he is in the
+@code{$mail_room:writers} list.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none enterfunc (obj @var{player})
+This function is triggered when a player moves into the room by the
+LambdaMOO server.  It performs a number of actions related to setting up
+the state of the mail room ready for the user to interact with the mail
+system.  The code for this verb is shown below:
+
+@example
+who = args[1];
+recips = this:recipient_names(who);
+if (this:message_so_far(who))
+  player:tell("You are in the middle of writing a letter to ", 
+          recips, ".  To discard that message, type 'abort'.");
+  this:print_msg(who);
+else
+  player:tell("Sending a message to ", recips, " ...");
+  pass(@@args);
+endif
+@end example
+
+First, we get the list of recipients for the mail message (specified
+before the player has entered the room).  If the player already has part
+of a message stored in the mail room, then s/he is allowed to continue
+the message.
+
+Finally, @code{pass()} is used to invoke the @code{$room} class verb
+@code{:enterfunc}.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none add_writer (obj @var{player}, list @var{recipients})
+This verb is used to add a plyer to the list of people composing letters
+in the mail room.  Only players are allowed to do this.  If the player
+is not already composing a message, then s/he is simply added to the
+list of @dfn{writers} for the room.  This causes @var{player} to be
+added to the @code{$mail_room:writers} property.
+
+In addition to this, the @code{recipients} list is added to the list,
+@code{$mail_room:recipients}.  The original location of the player
+(before being moved to the mail room) is stored in the
+@code{$mail_room:places} list.  The subject line and message text for
+this message is set to the empty string, in the property lists
+@code{$mail_room:subjects} and @code{$mail_room:messages}.  The message
+is also marked as being abortable, by adding a @samp{0} to the
+@code{$mail_room:abortable} list.  This is done because there is no
+warning given for deletion of an empty message.
+
+If the player is already in the list of people composing messages in the
+mail room, then the @code{listset()} primitive is used to change the
+recipients, subject and abortable property for the message associated
+with the player.  This means that a player can only be composing one
+message at a time.
+
+Once the above has been performed, the player is moved from his/her
+current location to the mail room.  A suitable message is sent to all
+the objects in the player's current location telling them what has
+happened.
+
+Throughout all user interaction in the mail room, the position of the
+player object reference in the @code{$mail_room:writers} list is used to
+index into all the other property lists used when dealing with a mail
+message. 
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb list recipients (obj @code{player})
+This verb returns the list of recipients for the message being composed
+by @var{player}.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb list message_so_far (obj @var{player})
+This verb returns the text of the message currently being composed by
+@var{player}.  This is returned as a list of strings.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none say (string @var{text})
+This verb overrides the @code{$room} class definition.  It is
+intercepted to allow the mail program to capture input from the user to
+append to the message currently being composed.  The
+@code{$mail_room:say} verb itself just passes the player object
+reference and @var{text} to the @code{$mail_room:add_line} verb for
+processing.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none emote (string @var{text})
+This verb overrides the @code{$room} class definition.  It is
+intercepted to allow the mail program to capture input from the user to
+append to the message currently being composed.  The
+@code{$mail_room:say} verb itself just passes the player object
+reference and @var{text}, with the player name prepended, to the
+@code{$mail_room:add_line} verb for processing.
+
+This allows both @samp{say} and @samp{emote} input to be captured in the
+current message.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none add_line (obj @var{player}, string @var{text})
+This verb is used to add @var{text} to the current message being
+composed by @var{player}.  Once a line has been added to a text message,
+it is not allowed to be immediately aborted.  This is set using the
+@code{$mail_room:clear_abortable} verb.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none print ()
+This verb is a player command used to print the text stored in the
+current message.  The code itself first allows the message to be
+aborted, using @code{$mail_room:clear_abortable}, and then calls
+@code{$mail_room:print_msg} to print the message text.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none print_msg (obj @var{player})
+This verb prints the text of the current message being composed by
+@code{player}.  Again, the code is fairly simple, and is shown below:
+
+@example
+who = args[1];
+who:tell("Your message so far:");
+who:tell();
+who:tell_lines(this:message_with_headers(who));
+who:tell();
+who:tell("<End of message>");
+@end example
+
+Note the use of the @code{$root_class:tell_lines} verb to print the message
+contents.  @code{$mail_room:message_with_headers} returns a list of
+strings comprising the mail header, and message text.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb list recipient_names (obj @var{player})
+This verb returns a list of the names of the recipients of the current
+message being composed by @code{player}.  It retrieves the correct list
+of recipients from the @code{$mail_room:recipients} property list, and
+then maps this from a list of object references to a list of object
+names using @code{$mail_room:name_list}.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none pause ()
+This is a player command used to temporarily stop composition of a
+message by a player.  A suitable message is printed by the player, and
+then the @code{$mail_room:send_back} verb is invoked to send the player
+back to the room s/he was in when letter composition was started.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none send_back (obj @var{player})
+This verb is used to return a player to the room s/he was in when a
+letter composition command was invoked.   When a player enters the mail
+room, the original location of the player is stored in the property list
+@code{$mail_room:places}.  This verb causes that location to be looked
+up, and the player is returned to his/her original location.  A suitable
+message is sent to the objects in the player's original location to
+inform them that s/he has returned from the mail room.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none look_self ()
+This verb overrides the @code{$room} class definition.  This is done to
+inhibit the room name and contents list being printed when the player
+uses the @samp{look} command.  Instead, this verb uses
+@code{$mail_room:description} as help text, which is sent to the player
+using @code{$root_class:tell_lines}.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none help ()
+This verb is a player command invoked to get some help on the mail room
+facilities.  This results in the @code{$mail_room:look_self} verb being
+called to print the help text stored in the mail room description.  Note
+that this overrides, also, the LambdaMOO help system.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none abort ()
+This is a player command used to abort composition of a message, and
+throw the text away.  A check is made to see if the message is
+abortable.  If it is, then the player is sent back to his/her original
+location, and the message is destroyed using @code{$mail_room:destroy}.
+
+If this message is marked as being non-abortable, the player is given an
+@samp{Are you sure?!} message.  The @code{$mail_room:abortable} property
+is used to provide a safety net for players.  Typing @code{abort} once
+will not throw away the message, unless it is empty. 
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb num abortable (obj @var{player})
+This verb is used to return the @code{abortable} status of the message
+currently being entered by @code{player}.  The
+@code{$mail_room:abortable} property list contains a boolean value for
+each player currently composing a message.  The mechanism is included to
+stop a player accidentally deleting a message by using the @samp{abort}
+command.  If the @code{abortable} flag for a message is set, then the
+message may be deleted by using the @samp{abort} command.  If the flag
+is clear, then deletion is prevented.
+
+One invocation of @samp{abort} results in an @samp{Are you sure?!}
+message being printed, and the @code{$mail_room:abortable} flag for the
+player's message is reset to allow aborts.  A subsequent @samp{abort} by
+the player will then destroy the message.
+
+An empty message can be aborted without any warning.  Once a line of
+text has been entered into a message, this saftey feature is enabled by
+clearing the @code{abortable} flag for the message.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none set_abortable obj @var{player}
+This verb is used to set the @code{$mail_room:abortable} flag for the
+message currently being composed by @var{player}.   If the flag is set,
+the message is allowed to be aborted.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none clear_abortable ()
+This verb is used to clear the @code{$mail_room:abortable} flag for the
+message currently being composed by @var{player}.   If the flag is
+reset, the message cannoted be aborted.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none exitfunc obj (@var{player})
+This verb is invoked when a player leaves the mail room.  It clears the
+@code{abortable} flag for the @var{player}'s message, and then invokes
+the @code{exitfunc} of the parent class.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none destroy (obj @var{player})
+This verb is used to delete the message currently being composed by
+@var{player}.  This involves removing the message state from the various
+property lists stored in the room.  The code for this verb is shown
+below, as the best explanation:
+
+@example
+who = args[1];
+pos = who in this.writers;
+this.writers = listdelete(this.writers, pos);
+this.recipients = listdelete(this.recipients, pos);
+this.messages = listdelete(this.messages, pos);
+this.places = listdelete(this.places, pos);
+this.abortable = listdelete(this.abortable, pos);
+this.subjects = listdelete(this.subjects, pos);
+@end example
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none send ()
+This verb is a player command invoked to send the current message to the
+list of recipients.  It retrieves the message as a list of strings, and
+then sends it to each recipient in turn.  Note that no third part mail
+agent is involved.  When the @samp{send} command is invoked by a player,
+it delivers mail to the recipients using the verb
+@code{$player:receive_message}.
+
+After a message has been sent, it is destroyed.  The invoking player is
+returned to the room s/he was in when the mail system was started.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb list message_with_headers (obj @var{player})
+This verb returns a list of strings, giving the message plus any headers
+which are added to the front by the mail system.  The
+@code{$mail_room:make_message} verb is used to produce the list of
+strings.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb string the_subject (obj @var{player})
+This verb returns the subject text for the message being composed by
+@var{player}.  This is done by retrieving the correct entry from the
+property list @code{$mail_room:subjects}.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none sub*ject ()
+This is a player command used to set the subject text of the current
+message.  A simple call is made to the @code{$mail_room:set_subject}
+verb, with the arguments supplied by the player in @code{argstr}.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none to ()
+This is a player command used to set the list of recipients for the
+current message.  Without any arguments, the command prints the current
+list of recipients.  If one or more arguments are supplied, then the
+recipients list for the message is cleared, and the verb
+@code{$mail_room:also-to} is invoked to take tge player arguments, and
+set the message recipients list accordingly.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none set_subject (obj @var{player})
+This verb is used to set the subject text for the message being composed
+by @var{player}.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none also*-to (string @var{args})
+This verb goes through the list of names given in @var{args} adding each
+name to the recipients list for the current message.  The code for the
+verb is shown below:
+
+@example
+pos = player in this.writers;
+recips = this.recipients[pos];
+for x in (args)
+  r = $string_utils:match(x, players(), "aliases");
+  if (r == $failed_match)
+    player:tell("There is no player named '", x, "'.");
+    return;
+  elseif (r == $ambiguous_match)
+    player:tell("I don't know which '", x, "' you mean.");
+    return;
+  endif
+  recips = setadd(recips, r);
+endfor
+this.recipients = listset(this.recipients, recips, pos);
+player:tell("Your message is now to ", this:recipient_names(player), ".");
+@end example
+
+Each name in the argument list is matched to a player name.  If there is
+no match, the name is rejected from the list of recipients, and further
+processing is aborted. If there is a match, the player object reference
+is added to the list of recipients.  If there is an ambiguous match, the
+name is ignored, and further processing is aborted.
+
+Valid names are added one by one to the recipient list for the message.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb list make_message (obj @var{player}, list @var{to}, string @var{subj}, list @var{msg})
+This verb returns the message as it will be sent to the recipients in
+the list @var{to}.  It takes the arguments given, and puts together a
+list of strings that gives the current message being written by
+@var{player}.  In addition to the supplied arguments, the date and
+sender's name are added to the message as header.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb string name_list (list @var{names})
+This verb returns an english style list of the names in @var{names}.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none send_message (obj @var{from}, list @var{to}, string @var{subj}, list @var{msg})
+This verb is used to actually send a mail message to the players given
+in the @var{to} list of recipients.  If you wish to send mail from
+another verb, this is the verb to use.  The arguments given are passed
+to @code{$mail_room:make_message} for formatting, and then sent to each
+of the recipients in turn.
+@end deftypefn
+
+
+The following properties are defined for the @code{$mail_room} class.
+Each property contains a list of items, one per player currently
+composing a letter.  The index of the player in the @code{writers} list
+is used to locate the correct entries for that player's message in all
+the other property lists.
+
+@defvr Property subjects
+This is a list of strings.  Each string contains the subject line for a
+message currently being composed.
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property abortable
+This is a list of boolean (number) values.  If set, the relevant message
+can be aborted by the player using the @samp{abort} command in the mail
+room.  If not set, the message cannot be aborted.
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property places
+This is a list of room object references.  When a player enters the mail
+room, using one of the mail composition commands, his/her current
+location is stored here.  When the player has finished in the mail room,
+s/he is returned to the original room.
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property recipients
+This is a list of lists of object references, referring to players.
+Each entry in the list looks like the following :
+
+@example
+@{@var{player1}, @var{player2}, @dots{}, playerN@}
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+The message currently being composed will be sent to @var{player1} thru
+@var{playerN} when it is @samp{sent}.
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property messages
+This property stores the actual message text being composed by the
+player.  Each entry in the list is a list of strings, one per line of
+the message.
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property writers
+This is the list of players currently engaged in composing a message in
+the mail room.  Every time a player enters the mail room using one of
+the mail commands, his/her object reference is added to this list.  If a
+player enters the mail room and is already on this list, this indicates
+a resumption of a previously @samp{pause}d mail session.
+@end defvr
+
+@subsection The generic Editor Class
+This class provides a basic MOO code editing facility for those players
+who do not have access to an external editor such as Emacs.  It provides
+basic facilities for editing and compiling MOO code on verbs, but cannot
+be considered complete or extensive.
+
+@subsection The System Object Class
+The @dfn{system object} class is the fundamental cornerstone of the
+whole LambdaMOO database.  It is the first item in the database, and
+hence has an object number of @samp{#0}.  It has no verbs defined on it,
+but a number of interesting properties that are used to determine the
+behaviour of parts of the LambdaMOO server and Core functions.
+
+In particular, properties defined on the root class can be referred to
+using the @samp{$} notation as a shorthand.  For example, if I define a
+property called 
+
+@example
+#0.foobar = #1234
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+then I can refer to @samp{#1234} thereafter using the shorthand 
+
+@example
+$foobar
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+
+Shorthand references are provided for all of the base classes.  If a new
+public class is added, it should be given a shorthand by adding a
+suitable property to the system object, @samp{#0}.  In this way, players
+can refer to the shorthand when creating objects that belong to the new
+class.
+
+For example, if @code{foobar} were the name of a new class, then I could
+use
+
+@example
+@@create $foobar named gadget
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+to create an instance of the class @code{foobar}.
+
+Shorthand notation is provided in the following properties.  Most of
+them refer to public classes.  A few refer to other, global values that
+are used in the database.

+@end defvr
+
+The other properties defined for the system object are listed below,
+with details given as to their function and derivation.
+
+@defvr Property wizard_mail_recipients
+This property is a list of object numbers.  It gives a list of people
+who will receive mail sent by players to the wizard.  This can
+loosely be interpreted as being a list of players that are involved in
+running the game, and are not strictly wizards.
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property gripe_recipients
+This property is a list of object numbers.  It gives a list of people
+who will receive mail sent by players using @samp{@@gripe}.  This can
+loosely be interpreted as being a list of players that are involved in
+running the game, and are not strictly wizards.
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property dump_interval
+This property specified the interval between database dumps, in seconds.
+The default value is 600 seconds, which is every ten minutes.  A
+database dump should be initiated at regular intervals to provide a
+backup in case the LambdaMOO server crashes, or the host machine goes
+down.
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property welcome_message
+This property is a list of strings containing the message sent to
+players when they log in to the LambdaMOO server.  It should be used to
+convey simple help information to first time players, as well as making
+urgent announcements that you wish everyone to see.
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property player_start
+This is an object reference of the starting room for new players.  When
+a player is created, using the @samp{create} command when initially
+connecting to the LambdaMOO server, s/he is placed in the
+@code{$player_start} room.  This is also set as the default
+home for a new player.  If you wish to place new players into a
+different starting room, then you should change the object reference
+stored in @code{$player_start}.
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property player_class
+This is an object reference for the class that newly created players
+belong to by default.    The initial value of this property is
+@code{$player}.  If you create an enhanced player class that you wish
+all new players to belong to, you should change the value of this
+property to be the object reference of the new, enhanced player class.
+@end defvr
+
+@subsection The Container Class
+A container is a an object that can hold other object inside itself.
+This is similar to the idea of a room,  except that a container has no
+notion of exits, and can only hold things;  it cannot hold players.
+
+The following verbs are defined for the container class.
+
+@deftypefn Verb none d*rop (obj @var{object})
+@deftypefnx Verb none in*sert (obj @var{object})
+@deftypefnx Verb none p*ut (obj @var{object})
+This verb puts @var{object} into the container.  The container is first
+checked to verify that it is open, if not an error message is printed.
+
+For example, if you have a container named @var{pipe} and an object named
+@var{tobacco}, you could enter:
+
+@example
+put tobacco in pipe
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+If @var{pipe} is open, then @var{tobacco} will be put into the
+@var{pipe}.  If you look at @var{pipe} you should see:
+
+@example
+pipe
+Contents:
+  tobacco
+@end example
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none g*et (obj @var{object})
+@deftypefnx Verb none ta*ke (obj @var{object})
+@deftypefnx Verb none re*move (obj @var{object})
+This does the opposite of the put/insert/drop commands.  To remove the
+@var{tobacco} from the @var{pipe} you would enter:
+
+@example
+remove tobacco from pipe
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+When you look at @var{pipe} now you should see:
+
+@example
+pipe
+It is empty.
+@end example
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none open ()
+This verb will open the container and allow objects to be put into it
+(via the @var{put} verb).  This verb sets the property @var{opened} to
+@samp{1}. 
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none @@lock_for_open (obj @var{object})
+This verb will lock the container with @var{object}.  The container can
+only be opened if the player is holding @var{object}, or the
+@var{object} is the player trying to open the container.  The container
+will remained locked until it is unlocked (see below).
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none @@unlock_for_open ()
+This verb will remove the lock set by @var{@@unlock_for_open}.  It can
+only be run by the owner of the container.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb num is_openable_by (obj PLAYER)
+This verb uses the @code{$lock_utils:eval_key} verb to determine if the
+container can be opened by the player.  The verb will return @samp{1} if
+the player has permission to open the container, and @samp{0} otherwise.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none close ()
+This is the opposite of @var{open}.  If the pipe is already close, an
+error message is printed.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none tell_contents ()
+This verb displays the contents of the container.  If the container is
+empty, the message @samp{It is empty} is displayed.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none set_opened (int @var{number})
+This verb is called by @var{open} and @var{close}, with the arguments
+@samp{1} and @samp{0} respectively.  The property @var{opened} is set to
+either @samp{1} (opened) or @samp{0} (closed).
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none @@opacity (int @var{number})
+Opacity determines when/if you can look at the contents of the
+container.  There are three levels of opacity:
+
+@example
+0 - transparent
+1 - opaque
+2 - black hole
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+When the opacity is set to 0, you can see the contents when the pipe
+is open or closed.  When the opacity is set to 1, you can only see the
+contents when the container is open.  If opacity is set to 2, you can
+never see the contents when looking at the container.  
+
+@noindent
+The syntax for @samp{@@opacity} is:
+
+@example
+@@opacity container is #
+
+where '#' is either 0, 1 or 2.
+@end example
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb int set_opaque (int @var{number})
+This verb is called by @samp{@@opacity}.  It sets the property @var{opaque} to
+be either 0, 1 or 2.  
+@end deftypefn
+
+
+@subsection The Note Class
+The note class provides a handy way of communicating in MOO, whether you
+want to leave somebody a quick message, or perhaps leave a clue for
+solving an adventure.  The note class can also provide a good starting
+base for more specialized objects.  The letter and newspaper objects are
+examples of this.
+
+@deftypefn Verb none r*ead ()
+This verb first checks to see if the note can be read by the person who
+is attempting to read the it.  If they have permission to read it, the
+note text, which is stored in the property @code{text}, is shown to the
+player.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none er*ase ()
+This verb erases all text stored on the note.  Only the owner of a note
+can erase it.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none wr*ite (string @var{message})
+Appends the string @var{message} to the note text.  This function simply
+adds another line to the list stored in the note property 'text'.  A
+carriage return is inserted between each list entry, therefore the
+command:
+
+@example
+write "Zaphod was here." on note
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+would be read as
+
+@example
+Zaphod was here.
+@end example
+whereas the commands
+
+@example
+write "Zaphod" on note
+write "was" on note
+write "here." on note
+@end example
+
+would be read as
+
+@example
+Zaphod
+was
+here.
+@end example
+
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none del*ete (string @var{line-number})
+@deftypefnx Verb none rem*ove (string @var{line-number})
+Deletes the given line number from the note.  Only the owner of the note
+may modify it.  Negative numbers can be given to delete lines counting
+from the end of the note, hence @samp{delete -5 from note} would delete
+the 5th line from the bottom.
+@end deftypefn
+     
+@deftypefn Verb list text ()
+Returns a list of strings containing the message text on the note.
+Called by the verb @code{:r*ead}.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb num is_readable_by (obj PLAYER)
+This verb uses the @code{$lock_utils:eval_key} verb to evaluate the key,
+stored in the @code{encryption_key} property, and determine if the note
+is readable or not by the player.  This verb will return a @samp{1} if it is
+readable, or a @samp{0} if it is not.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none encrypt (string ENCRYPTION)
+This verb will encrypt a message so that it can only be read if the
+encryption constraints are satisfied. Refer to the @samp{@@lock} command
+for details on the syntax for encryption. Encryption is stored in the
+@code{encryption_key} property.  You must have permission to do this.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none decrypt ()
+This verb will remove any existing encryption from a note, allowing it
+to be read by anybody.  You must have permission to do this.
+@end deftypefn
+
+The following properties are defined for the @code{$note} class.
+
+@defvr Property encryption_key
+This is encryption string for the note. It is formed within the verb
+@code{:encrypt} by parsing its input with
+@code{$lock_utils:parse_keyexp}.  The verb @code{:is_readable_by} then
+uses this to determine whether or not the note can be read by calling
+@code{$lock_utils:eval_key}.
+
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property text
+This is a list of strings where the body of the note message is kept.
+Each entry in the list corresponds to one line in the note text.
+@end defvr
+
+@subsection The Newspaper Class
+To be written.
+
+@subsection The Letter Class
+The letter class is a subclass of the note class.  A letter object provides
+all of the functions of a note, with the addition of a @samp{burn} command.
+This command will recycle the note after it has been read by the recipient,
+completely removing it from the database.  The letter is read, written,
+erased and encrypted just as if it were simply a note object.
+
+@deftypefn Verb none burn
+This verb first checks to see if the letter is readable by the person
+who is attempting to burn it.  If it is, the letter will be completely
+destroyed.  If it is not readable, the command will fail.  The code for
+this is shown below for illustration:
+
+@example
+if (this:is_readable_by(player))
+  player:tell(this.name, 
+         " might be damp, in any case it won't burn.");
+else
+  player:tell(this.name, 
+      " burns with a smokeless flame, and leaves no ash.");
+  player.location:announce(player.name, 
+      " stares at ", this.name, " and it catches alight.");
+  recycle(this);
+endif
+@end example
+
+@end deftypefn
+
+@subsection The Generic Programmer Class
+
+@subsection The Help Database Class
+The LambdaCore database provides an extensive help facility.   As well
+as command syntax, it provides other useful information on a variety of
+other MUD topics.  The @code{$help} class is used to store help text and
+verbs used to implement the help system.  A verb on the player class,
+@code{$player:help} is used to give the player access to the help
+database.
+
+Each entry in the help database is stored as a property on the
+@code{$help} class.  By doing this, an index can be generated by using
+the @code{properties()} primitive to list all the properties on
+@code{$help}.   No other properties are stored on the @code{$help}
+class.
+
+The @samp{help} command, defined on the @code{$player} class, is
+described below.
+
+@deftypefn Verb none help 
+@deftypefnx Verb none help @var{topic}
+@deftypefnx Verb none help @strong{index}
+This verb, part of the player class, is used to gain access to the help
+system.   The first form is used to obtain help on the topic
+@code{summary}, which is a top level help with pointers to other topics
+in the database.
+
+If the third form, @samp{help index} is used, the verb
+@code{$help:print_index} is invoked to print a list of all the help
+topics currently available.
+
+The most complex case is the second form, where help is being requested
+on a particular topic.   The relevant code segment is shown below:
+
+@example
+  topics = $help:find_topics(dobjstr);
+  if (topics == @{@})
+    player:tell("Sorry, but no help is available on \"",
+          dobjstr, "\".");
+    return;
+  elseif (length(topics) > 1)
+    player:tell("Sorry, but the topic-name \"", 
+              dobjstr, "\" is ambiguous.", 
+     " I don't know which of the following topics you mean:");
+    for x in (topics)
+      player:tell("   ", x);
+    endfor
+    return;
+  else
+    topic = topics[1];
+    if (topic != dobjstr)
+      player:tell("Showing help on \"", topic, "\" ...");
+      player:tell();
+    endif
+  endif
+  $help:print_topic(topic);
+@end example
+
+First, the verb @code{$help:find_topics} is called.  This takes the
+@var{topic} given by the player, and searches through the help database
+index for possible matches.  This returns a list of possible topics in
+the variable @var{topics}.
+
+If the list is empty, than no help was available for the topic given by
+the player, and the verb ends.
+
+If the list contains more than one item, the player is told what
+matched, and asked to be more specific next time.
+
+If just one help topic was found, it is printed out, using the verb
+@code{$help:print_topic}. 
+@end deftypefn
+
+The @code{$help} class has three verbs defined on it which are used to
+implement the help system.  They are described in detail below:
+
+@deftypefn Verb list find_topics (string @var{handle})
+This verb is used to search the list of topics on the @code{$help} class
+for one that matches @var{handle}.  The list of topics is given by the
+list of properties defined on the @code{$help} class.   In the simple
+case, if the @var{handle} matches one property name exactly, then this
+name is returned.
+
+The player is allowed to omit the leading @samp{@@} on commands.  This
+is checked for in this verb by adding an @samp{@@} temporarily, and then
+checking for this in the topic list, along with the un-prefixed
+@var{handle}.
+
+If no direct match is found, the verb looks at all the properties stored
+on the @code{$help} class, and tries to make a match using
+@code{index()} between the @var{handle}, the @var{handle} with an
+@samp{@@} prepended and all the property names.  Every possible match is
+returned by this verb, so that the @samp{help} command can give the list
+to the user.
+
+If no matches are found, an empty list is returned.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none print_index ()
+This verb is used to print an alphabetical list of help topics, as given
+by the properties stored on the @code{$help} class.  The code for this
+function is shown below, as it illustrates one method of sorting strings
+in MOO, using lists.
+
+@example
+topics = setremove(properties(this), "summary");
+buckets = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz";
+else_bucket = length(buckets) + 1;
+counts = names = @{@};
+for i in [1..else_bucket]
+  names = @{@@names, @{""@}@};
+  counts = @{@@counts, 1@};
+endfor
+keys = names;
+count = 1;
+for name in (topics)
+  if (name && index(".@@", name[1]))
+    key = name[2..length(name)];
+  else
+    key = name;
+  endif
+  k = index(buckets, key[1]) || else_bucket;
+  bucket = keys[k];
+  count = counts[k];
+  i = 1;
+  while (i <= count && key > bucket[i])
+    i = i + 1;
+  endwhile
+  names = listset(names, listappend(names[k], name, i - 1), k);
+  keys = listset(keys, listappend(keys[k], key, i - 1), k);
+  counts = listset(counts, count + 1, k);
+endfor
+sorted = @{@};
+for i in [1..length(names)]
+  sorted = @{@@sorted, @@names[i][2..counts[i]]@};
+endfor
+sorted = @{@@sorted, "", "", ""@};
+n = length(sorted) / 4;
+su = $string_utils;
+for i in [1..n]
+  player:tell(su:left(sorted[i], 20), 
+              su:left(sorted[i + n], 20), 
+              su:left(sorted[i + n + n], 20), 
+              sorted[i + 3 * n]);
+endfor

+
+@end table
+@end display
+
+@subsection The String Utilities Class
+The string utilities class, @code{$string_utils} defines a number of
+verbs useful for performing operations on strings.
+
+@deftypefn Verb list explode (list @var{subject} [, str @var{break}])
+This verb is used to explode a string into a list of substrings
+separated by runs of @var{break} as the delimiting character. If
+@var{break} is not specified it defaults to space. As an example:
+
+@example
+$string_utils:explode("This    is a   test");
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+will return the list
+
+@example
+@{"This", "is", "a", "test"@}
+@end example
+
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb str from_list (list @var{list} [, str @var{separator}])
+This verb is used to implode the string representations of the elements
+of a list into a single string, each pair being separated by
+@var{separator}.  which defaults to the empty string. This function is
+essentially the inverse of @code{:explode}.  Note that the elements of
+@var{list} need not be strings themselves, as the function @code{tostr}
+is applied to each element before it is catenated. As an example, to
+reassemble the list above into the original string, with just one space
+between words, you could write:
+
+@example
+oldstr = $string_utils:from_list(@{"This", "is", "a", "test"@}, " ");
+@end example
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb object match (str @var{string} [, list @var{obj-list}, str @var{prop-name}]*)
+This verb is used to search for a match to @var{string} in all the
+specified properties of all the specified objects, returning either
+object, @code{$ambiguous_match} or @code{$failed_match}.
+
+Each @var{obj-list} should be a list of objects or a single object,
+which is treated as if it were a list of that object.  Each
+@var{prop-name} should be a string naming a property on every object in
+the corresponding @var{obj-list}.  The value of that property in each
+case should be either a string or a list of strings.
+
+The argument string is matched against all of the strings in the
+property values.
+
+If it exactly matches exactly one of them, the object containing that
+property is returned.  If it exactly matches more than one of them,
+@code{$ambiguous_match} is returned.
+
+If there are no exact matches, then partial matches are considered, ones
+in which the given string is a prefix of some property string.  Again,
+if exactly one match is found, the object with that property is
+returned, and if there is more than one match, @code{$ambiguous_match}
+is returned.
+
+Finally, if there are no exact or partial matches, then
+@code{$failed_match} is returned.
+
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb str from_value (item @var{value} [, str @var{quote_strings} [, num @var{list_depth}]])
+This verb is used to print the given value into a string. Note that
+@var{quote_strings} defaults to 0 (false), and @code{list_depth}
+defaults to 1.  This is best described by example:
+
+@example
+$string_utils:from_value(v) gives:
+
+value result 5 "5" 5 + 3 "8" "5 + 3" "5 + 3" @{@} "@{@}" @{1,2,3@} "@{1,
+2, 3@}" @{1, @{2, 3@}, 4@} "@{1, @{list@}, 4@}" @{"1", @{2, 3@}, 4@}
+"@{1, @{list@}, 4@}"
+
+$string_utils:from_value(value, 1) gives:
+
+value                     result
+5                     "5"
+5 + 3                 "8"
+"5 + 3"               "\"5 + 3\""
+@{@}                    "@{@}"
+@{1,2,3@}               "@{1, 2, 3@}"
+@{1, @{2, 3@}, 4@}        "@{1, @{list@}, 4@}"
+@{"1", @{2, 3@}, 4@}      "@{\"1\", @{list@}, 4@}"
+
+
+$string_utils:from_value(value, 0, 2) gives:
+
+value                     result
+5                     "5"
+5 + 3                 "8"
+"5 + 3"               "5 + 3"
+@{@}                    "@{@}"
+@{1,2,3@}               "@{1, 2, 3@}"
+@{1, @{2, 3@}, 4@}        "@{1, @{2, 3@}, 4@}"
+@{"1", @{2, 3@}, 4@}      "@{1, @{2, 3@}, 4@}"
+
+$string_utils:from_value( value, 1, 2 ) gives:
+
+value                     result
+5                     "5"
+5 + 3                 "8"
+"5 + 3"               "\"5 + 3\""
+@{@}                    "@{@}"
+@{1,2,3@}               "@{1, 2, 3@}"
+@{1, @{2, 3@}, 4@}        "@{1, @{2, 3@}, 4@}"
+@{"1", @{2, 3@}, 4@}      "@{\"1\", @{2, 3@}, 4@}"
+@end example
+
+It is interesting to note that @code{:from_value} calls itself
+recursively, to evaluate lists.
+
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb str pronoun_sub (str @var{text} [, obj @var{who}])
+This verb is used to substitute the pronoun properties of @var{who} in
+all occurances of %s,%o,%p,%r in @var{text}. @var{who} is optional, and
+defaults to player. Also @samp{%n}, @samp{%d}, @samp{%i}, @samp{%t},
+@samp{%%} are substituted by @code{player}, @code{dobj}, @code{iobj},
+@code{this} and @code{%} respectively. Further, @samp{%(propname)} is
+substituted by @code{@var{who}.propname}.  Capitalised versions of each
+of these are: @samp{%S}, @samp{%O}, @samp{%P}, @samp{%R},
+@samp{%N},@samp{%D}, @samp{%I}, @samp{%T} and @samp{%(Propname)}. The
+full list is given below:
+
+@example
+Code       Property      Pronoun       Defaults
+----       --------      -------       -------
+%%                                    %

+@end example
+
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb str space (num @var{num} [, str @var{str}])
+This verb returns a string of @var{num} occurences of @var{str}.
+@var{str} is optional, and defaults to space (" ").
+
+@example
+:space(8)        returns   "        "
+:space(8, "z")   returns   "zzzzzzzz"
+:space(4, "<>")  returns   "<><><><>"
+@end example
+
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb str right (str @var{text}, num @var{len} [, str @var{fill}])
+This verb is used to right justify @var{text} in a string of length
+@var{len}.  @var{fill} is the optional fill character, which defaults to
+space. This function calls @code{$string_utils:space} (described above).
+It is interesting to note that text need not be a string, as
+@code{tostr()} is applied to it before justification.
+
+@example
+:right("help", 9)      returns   "     help"
+:right("me", 9, ".")   returns   ".......me"
+:right(200, 9, "*")    returns   "******200"
+:right(@{1,2@}, 9)       returns   "   @{list@}"
+@end example
+
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb str centre (str @var{text}, num @var{len} [, str @var{fill}])
+This verb (aka @code{$string_utils:center}) is used to centre @var{text}
+in a string of length @var{len}. @var{fill} is the optional fill
+character, which defaults to space.  This function calls
+@code{$string_utils:space}, (described above).
+
+@example
+:centre("help", 9)      returns   "  help   "
+:centre("me", 9, ".")   returns   "...me...."
+:centre(200, 9, "*")    returns   "***200***"
+:centre(@{1,2@}, 9)       returns   " @{list@}  "
+@end example
+
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb str left (str @var{text}, num @var{len} [, str @var{fill}])
+This verb is used to left justify @var{text} in a string of length
+@var{len}.  @var{fill} is the optional fill character, which defaults to
+space. This function calls @code{$string_utils:space}, (described
+above).  It is interesting to note that text need not be a string, as
+@code{tostr()} is applied to it before justification.
+
+@example
+:left("help", 9)      returns   "help     "
+:left("me", 9, ".")   returns   "me......."
+:left(200, 9, "*")    returns   "200******"
+:left(@{1,2@}, 9)       returns   "@{list@}   "
+@end example
+
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb str english_list (list @var{list} [str @var{empty} str @var{and} str @var{sep} str @var{penum}])
+This verb is used to return a list of things as an english sentence.
+Note that @code{tostr()} is applied, so things in the list need not
+necessarily be strings.
+
+The optional arguments allow you to control how the list is presented.
+@var{empty} is the string returned if the list is empty.  The default is
+@samp{nothing}.  @var{and} is the string to use instead of
+@samp{ and } in the list.  A common usage of this is
+replace @samp{ and } with @samp{ or }.
+@var{sep} is the separator to use between words, the default being
+@samp{ ,}.  Finally, @var{penum} is the string to use after the
+penultimate elements, before the @samp{and}.  The default is to have a
+comma without a space.
+
+@example
+:english_list(@{@})                         =  "nothing"
+:english_list(@{"cat"@})                    =  "cat"
+:english_list(@{"cat","dog"@})              =  "cat and dog"
+:english_list(@{"cat","dog","pig"@})        =  "cat, dog, and pig"
+:english_list(@{1@})                        =  "1"
+:english_list(@{@{1, 2, 3@}, "Hi", 300@})     =  "@{list@}, Hi, and 300"
+@end example
+
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb str from_seconds (num @var{secs})
+This verb is used to return a string showing time in units of days,
+hours, minutes or seconds.
+
+@example
+:from_seconds(0)        returns  "0 seconds"
+:from_seconds(2)        returns  "2 seconds"
+:from_seconds(61)       returns  "a minute"
+:from_seconds(130)      returns  "2 minutes"
+:from_seconds(7000)     returns  "an hour"
+:from_seconds(1000000)  returns  "11 days"
+@end example
+
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb num find_prefix (str @var{subject}, list @var{choices})
+This verb is used to find a string from a list of @var{choices} which
+has the prefix @var{subject}.
+
+For example, if choices = @{"hat", "hand", "face", "help"@} then...
+
+@example
+:find_prefix("f",  choices)  ==  3  
+:find_prefix("g",  choices)  ==  0
+:find_prefix("h",  choices)  ==  $ambiguous_match
+:find_prefix("he", choices)  ==  4
+:find_prefix("ha", choices)  ==  $ambiguous_match
+@end example
+
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb str trim (str @var{text} [, str @var{what}])
+This verb is used to trim leading and trailing characters from the
+string @var{text}. @var{what} is the optional character to trim, and
+defaults to space.
+
+@example
+:trim("help")             returns  "help"
+:trim("   help   ")       returns  "help"
+:trim(">> help <<", ">")  returns  " help <<"
+@end example
+
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb str capitalise (str @var{text})
+@deftypefnx Verb str capitalize (str @var{text})
+@deftypefnx Verb str cap_fast (str @var{text})
+This verb is used to capitalise its argument. Note that it depends on
+@code{strcmp()} returning the difference of the first non-matching
+letters!
+
+@example
+:cap_fast("hello")     returns    "Hello"
+:cap_fast("Ezeke")     returns    "Ezeke"
+@end example
+   
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb str strip_chars (str @var{subject}, str @var{stripped})
+This verb is used to remove the characters in the string @var{stripped} from
+the string @var{subject}.
+
+@example
+:strip_chars("The quick brown fox", " ")      =  "Thequickbrownfox"
+:strip_chars("The quick brown fox", "aeiou")  =  "Th qck brwn fx"
+@end example
+
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb list match_player (str @var{name}, @dots{}, [obj @var{meobj})
+@deftypefnx Verb obj match_player (str @var{name}, obj @var{meobj})
+This verb is used to match one or more @var{name}s to player objects in
+the database.  Note that @var{name} need not be complete, nor in the
+same case as the player's actual name. If the @var{name} given is
+@samp{me}, then the value of @code{player}, or @var{meobj} is returned.
+If @var{meobj} is not a player, then @code{$failed_match} is returned.
+
+In the case where a name is not matched against a player name or alias,
+the value @code{$failed_match} is returned.  If a name matches more than
+one player, then the value @code{$ambiguous_match} is returned.
+
+For example:
+
+@example
+Verb Call                               Returned
+---------                               --------
+:match_player("blip")                   #35
+:match_player("bli")                    #35
+:match_player("blip", "Fred")           @{#35, $failed_match@}
+:match_player("blip", "Ezeke")          @{#35, #99@}
+:match_player("me", #35)                #35
+:match_player("me", #1234)              $failed_match
+:match_player("b")                      $ambiguous_match
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+This assumes that players named @samp{blip} and @samp{Ezeke} exist in
+the database, but @samp{Fred} doesn't.  Additionally, there is more than
+one player whose name starts with @samp{b}.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb list words (str @var{text})
+This verb is used to split a piece of @var{text} into words, in the same
+wat that the command line parser turns @code{args} into @code{argstr}.
+This verb differs from using, for example, @code{$string_utils:explode}
+in that it recognises a quoted piece of text as being one word.  For
+example:
+
+@example
+Verb Call                               Returned
+---------                               --------
+:words ("There is a dog.")              @{"There", "is", "a", "dog."@}
+:words ("A \"red nose\"")               @{"A", "red nose"@}
+:words ("")                             @{@}
+:words ("Hello")                        @{"Hello"@}
+@end example
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb str cap_property (obj @var{what}, str @var{prop}, [, num @var{ucase}]))
+This verb returns @var{what}.@var{prop}, but capitalised if either
+@var{ucase} is true, or the property name specified is capitalised.  If
+@var{prop} is blank, the verb returns the value of
+@code{@var{what}:title()}.  If @var{prop} is not specified on @var{what}
+or is otherwise irretrievable, then an error is returned. 
+
+If capitalisation is indicated by @var{ucase} being true, we return
+@code{@var{what}.@var{prop}c} if that exists, otherwise
+@var{what}.@var{prop} is capitalised in the normal fashion using
+@code{$string_utils:capitalise}.  A special case exists if we are trying
+to retrieve the name of a player.  This is never capitalised.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb num index_delimited (str @var{string}, str @var{target} [, num @var{casem}])
+This verb works in the same way as the primitive @code{index()}, except
+that it only matches on occurrences of @var{target} in @var{string} that
+are delimited by word boundaries.  That is, it will not match on
+occurrences that are preceded or followed by an alphanumeric.
+
+For example,
+
+@example
+Verb Call                                   Returned
+---------                                   --------
+:index_delimited ("Hi there", "he")            0
+:index_delimited ("Hi there", "hi")            1
+:index_delimited ("Hi there", "hi", 1)         0
+:index_delimited ("Hi there", "Hi", 1)         1
+@end example
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb num to_value (str @var{expr})
+This verb is used to convert a string into a value.  It is the opposite
+operation to @code{$string_utils:from_value}.  As with that verb, this
+is best explained by examples:
+
+@example
+$string_utils:to_value(s) gives:
+
+s                               result
+"5"                             5
+"5 + 3"                         "5 + 3"
+@{@}                              @error{}
+@{1,2,3@}                         @error{}
+"@{1,2,3@}"                       @{1,2,3@}                        
+@end example
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb list columnize columnise (list @var{items}, num @var{n} [, num @var{width}])
+This verb is used to turn a one-column list of items into an @var{n} column
+list. @var{width} is the last character position that may be occupied; it
+defaults to a standard screen width of 79 characters.
+
+For example, to tell a player a list of number in three columns, use the
+following code:
+
+@example
+player:tell_lines($string:utils:columnise (@{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7@}, 3));
+@end example
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb list parse_command (str @var{command}, @var{who})
+This verb is used to parse a command line, in the same way that the
+built in command line parser does the job.  It returns an horrendous
+list of stuff, that I'm not quite sure about yet.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb list match_str*ing (str @var{input}, str @var{match}, @dots{})
+This verb performs wildcard matching of @samp{match} to @var{input},
+using the @samp{*} character as a wildcard.  It returns a list of what
+the @code{*}s actually matched.  Note that this verb will not catch
+every match, if there are several different ways to parse the input.
+More than one wildcard string may be given.  If a numeric argument is
+given, it is taken to indicate whether case sensitivity should be used.
+
+For example:
+
+@example
+;$string_utils:match_string(\"Jack waves to Jill\",\"* waves to *\")
+@print{}@{\"Jack\", \"Jill\"@}
+@end example
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb str uppercase lowercase (str @var{string})
+This verb returns either the uppercase or lowercase version of
+@var{string}, as appropriate.
+@end deftypefn
+
+No properties are defined on the @code{$string_utils} class.
+
+@subsection The Permissions Utils Class
+The permission utilities class, @code{$perm_utils} provides a couple of
+useful verbs for dealing with permissions of objects, i.e.. the ability of
+a player to read or access another object.
+
+@deftypefn Verb num controls (obj @var{who}, obj @var{what})
+Returns true, @samp{1}, if @var{who} is the owner of @var{what}, or if
+@var{who} is a @emph{wizard}, else returns false, @samp{0}.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb str apply (str @var{perms}, str @var{mods})
+This verb is used to modify the permissions given in @var{perms} with
+the modifiers shown in @var{mods}.  The following modifiers are
+possible:
+
+@display
+@table @code
+@item !
+- negate a permission.
+@item +
+- add a permission.
+@item -
+- remove a permission.
+@end table
+@end display
+
+Consider the following examples:
+
+@example
+Verb Call                          Returns
+---------                          -------
+;$perm_utils:apply("rw", "!w")     "r"
+;$perm_utils:apply("rw", "!r")     "w"
+;$perm_utils:apply("rw", "-w")     "r"
+;$perm_utils:apply("rw", "")       ""
+;$perm_utils:apply("rw", "x")      "x"
+;$perm_utils:apply("rw", "+x")     "rwx"
+@end example
+@end deftypefn
+
+No properties are defined on the @code{$perm_utils} class.
+
+@subsection The Code Utils Class
+
+The code utils class is somewhere to hang code functions. These are
+defined as verbs of the @code{$code_utils} class.
+
+@deftypefn Verb list parse_propref (str @var{string})
+This function parses @var{string} as a MOO-code property reference,
+returning
+
+@example
+@{@var{object-string}, @var{prop-name-string}@}
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+for a successful parse and false otherwise. It always returns the right
+object-string to pass to, for example, @code{$room:match_object()}.
+
+The following examples show how this verb works:
+
+@example
+:parse_propref("me")               returns   0
+:parse_propref("me.name")          returns   @{"me", "name"@}
+:parse_propref("$room.location")   returns   @{"#3", "location"@}
+:parse_propref("$thing")           returns   @{"#0", "thing"@}
+:parse_propref("$player:tell")     returns   0
+@end example
+
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb list parse_verbref (str @var{string})
+This function parses @var{string} as a MOO-code verb reference, returning
+
+@example
+@{@var{object-string}, @var{verb-name-string}@}
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+for a successful parse and false otherwise. It always returns the right
+object-string to pass to, for example, @code{$room:match_object()}.
+
+The following examples show how this verb works:
+
+@example
+:parse_verbref("me")              returns   0
+:parse_verbref("me:title")        returns   @{"me", "title"@}
+:parse_verbref("$room:blow_up")   returns   @{"#3", "blow_up"@}
+:parse_verbref("$thing")          returns   0
+:parse_verbref("player:tell")     returns   @{"player", "tell"@}
+@end example
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none show_object (obj @var{obj})
+@deftypefnx Verb none show_property (obj @var{obj}, str @var{pname})
+@deftypefnx Verb none show_verbdef (obj @var{obj}, str @var{vname})
+These verbs are the ones used by the @samp{@@show} command to display
+details of an object, a property on an object, or a verb on an object.
+Below is some sample code used to display details on the paranoid
+property of ezeke:
+
+@example
+fullpropref = "ezeke.paranoid";
+here = player.location;
+prop = $code_utils:parse_propref(fullpropref);
+if (!prop)
+  player:tell("Could not parse string.");
+else
+  obj = here:match(prop[1]);
+  if (obj < #0)
+    player:tell("Could not match '", prop[1], "'.");
+  else
+    $code_utils:show_property(obj, prop[2]);
+  endif
+endif
+@end example
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none find_verbs_containing (str @var{pattern}, num @var{start_obj}, num @var{count})
+This verb prints to the player the name and owner of every verb in the
+database whose code contains @var{pattern} as a substring.  It starts at
+the object number @var{start_obj} (as a number, not an object) and goes
+to the end of the database.  @var{count} specifies how many verbs have
+been found so far.  Because it searches the entire database, this
+function may not be finished when it returns; it may have forked a task
+to continue the job.
+
+For example:
+@example
+>;$code_utils:find_verbs_containing ("show_property", 0, 0)
+@print{}#4:@@s*how, line 18 [Wizard (#2)]
+@end example
+@end deftypefn
+
+@subsection The Command Utilities Class
+The command utilities class, @code{$command_utils} provides a couple of
+useful verbs for dealing with player commands, as follows:
+
+@deftypefn Verb num object_match_failed (obj @var{result}, str @var{string})
+This function tells the player of a failed match, and returns true if so.
+If @var{result} is valid it returns false, without telling the player
+anything. For example, (where @code{#118} has been recycled):
+
+@example
+Result            String  Ret  Player sees...
+------            ------  ---  --------------
+$failed_match     "blip"   1   I see no "blip" here.
+$ambiguous_match  "blip"   1   I don't know which "blip" you mean.
+#118              ""       1   #118 does not exist.
+#28               "blip"   0
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+This could be used in the following way, in the implementation of a 'bop'
+command, defined as a verb on a player:
+
+@example
+/* bop <any> */
+here = player.location;
+victim = here:match(dobjstr);
+if (!$command_utils:object_match_failed(victim, dobjstr))
+  player:tell("You bop ", dobj.name, " over the head!");
+  dobj:tell(player.name, " bops you over the head!");
+  here:announce_all_but(@{player,dobj@}, 
+  player.name + " bops " + dobj.name + " over the head!");
+endif
+@end example
+
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none player_match_result (list @var{results}, list @var{strings}, [str @var{prefix}])
+This verb is used to inform the player of the results of trying to match
+the player names in @var{string} with players in the database.  It
+assumes that @var{results} are the result of a
+@code{$string_utils:match_player(strings)} and prints out nasty messages
+to the player concerning @var{strings} that didn't match with any player
+in teh database.  It returns a list, in the following format:
+
+@example
+@{@var{our_result}, @var{player1}, @dots{}, @var{playerN}@}
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+where @var{our_result} is an overall result, set to @samp{true} if some
+string didn't match, followed by the object reference numbers of players
+that matched.  An optional third argument, @var{prefix}, gives an
+identifying string to prefix to each of the nasty messages.
+
+For example, supposing there are only players named @samp{blip} and
+@samp{blipster} in the database:
+
+@example
+Results            Strings     Ret      Player Sees....
+-------            -------     ---      ---------------
+@{$nothing@}         @{"George"@}  0        @emph{nothing}
+@{$failed_match@}    @{"George"@}  1        "George" is not the 
+                                            name of any player.
+@{$ambiguous_match@} @{"blip"@}    1        "blip" could refer to any
+                                            of a number of people."
+@{#28@}              @{"blip"@}    @{0, #28@} @emph{nothing}
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+The following code fragment from @code{$player:page} shows how you might
+use this function in your own programs:
+
+@example
+who = $string_utils:match_player(args[1]);
+if ($command_utils:player_match_result(who, args[1])[1])
+  return;
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+The variable @var{args[1]} contains the name of the player we are trying
+to page
+@end deftypefn
+
+@noindent
+No properties are defined on the @code{$command_utils} class.
+
+@subsection The List Utilities Class
+
+The list utilities class, @code{$list_utils} defines a number of
+functions that manipulate lists.  
+
+@deftypefn Verb list map_prop (list @var{objs}, string @var{prop})
+This function returns a list of the values of a specified property
+@var{prop} on each of the objects in the list @var{objs}. If @var{prop}
+does not exist on one of the objects, an error occurs.
+
+As an example, the following code will list all the locations that have
+at least one player in them. It uses the @code{:map_prop} verb to
+generate a list corresponding to each player's location. Set addition is
+used to provide a list of the location names without duplication. Note
+that the @code{players()} primitive returns a list of all the player
+objects in the database.
+
+@example
+locs = $list_utils:map_prop(players(), "location");
+rooms = @{@};
+for x in (locs)
+  rooms = setadd(rooms, x.name);
+endfor
+player:tell("Inhabited locations are ", 
+             $string_utils:english_list(rooms), ".");
+@end example
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb list map_verb (list @var{objs}, string @var{verb} [, list @var{varg}])
+This function returns a list of the return values of a specified verb
+@var{verb} on each of the objects in the list @var{objs}. @var{varg} is
+optional and defines the arguments to @var{verb}; it defaults to the
+empty list @{@}. If @var{verb} does not exist on one of the objects, an
+error occurs.
+
+As an example, the following code will list all the connected players,
+using the @code{:title} verb on each to do so. It uses the
+@code{:map_verb} function to generate a list of each of the player's
+@dfn{title strings}.
+
+@example
+cp = $list_utils:map_verb(connected_players(), "title");
+player:tell("Connected players are ", 
+              $string_utils:english_list(cp), ".");
+@end example
+
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb list assoc (@var{target}, list @var{list}, [num @var{index}])
+This verb requires @var{list} to be a list of lists. It returns the
+first element of @var{list} whose own @var{index}th element is
+@var{target}.  If not supplied, @var{index} defaults to @samp{1}.
+
+Consider the following examples:
+
+@example
+Verb Call                        Returned
+---------                        --------
+:assoc(1, @{@{2,3@}, @{1, 2@}@})       @{1,2@}
+:assoc(1, @{@{2,3@}, @{2, 1@}@})       @{@}
+:assoc(1, @{@})                    @{@}
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+Consider a more interesting example.  Suppose that you have a list of
+heights for a number of players, in the following format:
+
+@example
+@{@{@var{name1}, @var{height1}@}, @dots{}, @{@var{nameN}, @var{heightN}@}@}
+@end example 
+
+@noindent
+and you want to search through the list to find out how tall a
+particular player is.  This can be done using the following code,
+assuming that the variable @var{heights} is the list of
+@samp{@{@var{name}, @var{height}@}} pairs, and @var{ourplayer} is
+the player whose height you wish to look up:
+
+@example
+player:tell(ourplayer, "is ", 
+    $list_utils:assoc (ourplayer, heights)[2], "ft high");
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+Suppose that @var{heights} is defined as follows:
+
+@example
+@{@{"blip", 2@}, @{"Ezeke", 6@}, @{"Geezer", 10@}@}
+@end example
+
+@noindent 
+For different lookups, we would get the following results:
+
+@example
+ourplayer                   Results
+blip                        @{"blip", 2@}
+Ezeke                       @{"Ezeke", 6@}
+Fred                        @{@}
+@end example
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb num iassoc (@var{target}, list @var{list}, [num @var{index}])
+This verb works similarly to @code{$string_utils:assoc} except that it
+returns an index into @var{list}, rather than the actual matching
+element from @var{list}.  If no matching element is found, it returns
+@samp{0}.
+Consider the following examples:
+
+@example
+Verb Call                        Returned
+---------                        --------
+:assoc(1, @{@{2,3@}, @{1, 2@}@})       2
+:assoc(1, @{@{2,3@}, @{2, 1@}@})       0
+:assoc(1, @{@})                    0
+@end example
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb list sort_alist (list @var{list}, [num @var{index}])
+This verb requires @var{list} to be a list of lists. It sorts the
+@var{list} into ascending order, using the @var{index}th element of each
+list element as the sort key.  For example:
+
+@example
+Verb Call                         Returned
+---------                         --------
+sort_alist(@{@{5@}, @{2@}, @{3@}@})       @{@{2@}, @{3@}, @{5@}@}
+sort_alist(@{@})                    @{@}
+sort_alist(@{@{2,3@},@{5,1@},@{3,6@}@},2) @{@{5,1@},@{2,3@},@{3,6@}@}  
+@end example
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb list map_pronoun_sub (list @var{objects}, @var{string})
+This verb returns the result of calling @code{$string_utils:pronoun_sub}
+for each object in the list @var{objects} on the @var{string} supplied.
+For example, where @samp{#28} is named @samp{blip}, and @samp{#35} is
+named Ezeke:
+
+@example
+our_objs=@{#28,#35@};
+our_msg="Hello %n";
+our_output=$list_utils:map_pronoun_sub(our_objs, our_msg);
+player:tell_lines (our_output);
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+Executing this short program would produce the following output
+
+@example
+>run_test_program
+@print{}Hello blip.
+@print{}Hello Ezeke.
+@end example
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb list slice (list @var{list}, [num @var{index}])
+This verb returns a list of the @var{index}th elements of the elements
+of @var{list}.  If @var{index} is not given, it defaults to @samp{1}.
+For example,
+
+@example
+Verb Call                          Returns
+---------                          -------
+:slice (@{@{1,2@}, @{3,4@}, @{5,6@}@}@})    @{1,3,5@}
+:slice (@{@{1,2@}, @{3,4@}, @{5,6@}@}@},2)  @{2,4,6@}
+:slice (@{@}@}                        @{@}
+@end example
+@end deftypefn
+
+@noindent
+No properties are defined on the @code{$list_utils} class.
+
+@subsection The Building Utils Class
+
+This class provides a couple of utility functions used in building rooms
+and exits in the core database structure.  The verbs provided are used
+mainly by the building command @samp{@@dig}, although they can, of
+course, be used by other verbs.
+
+@deftypefn Verb none set_names (obj @var{object}, string @var{spec})
+The function is used to set both the name of an object and any aliases
+that the programmer needs.  It expects 2 arguments: first, the object
+reference whose name is to be set, and then a string which contains the
+name and any aliases as a comma delimited string.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none make_exit (string @var{spec}, obj @var{source}, obj @var{dest})
+This is a function that is used to create a named exit with given source
+and destination rooms.  The code will do a protection check to verify
+that an exit can be created and which if any links specified can be
+made.
+
+The following will try to create an exit called @samp{Out} owned by the
+calling player and then link that exit to #25 as the source (exit from)
+and #26 as the destination (entrance to).
+
+@example
+$building_utils:make_exit("Out", #25, #26);
+@end example
+@end deftypefn
+
+@subsection The Lock Utilities Class
+This class provides some useful functions related to the use of
+@dfn{locks} for objects in the database. The LambdaCore database
+supports a simple but powerful notation for specifying locks on objects,
+encryption on notes, and other applications.  The idea is to describe a
+constraint that must be satisfied concerning what some object must be or
+contain in order to use some other object.
+
+The constraint is given in the form of a logical expression, made up of
+object numbers connected with the operators @samp{and}, @samp{or}, and
+@samp{not} (written @samp{&&}, @samp{||}, and @samp{!}, for
+compatibility with the MOO programming language).
+
+These logical expressions (called @dfn{key expressions}) are always
+evaluated in the context of some particular @dfn{candidate} object, to see
+if that object meets the constraint.  To do so, we consider the
+candidate object, along with every object it contains (and the ones
+those objects contain, and so on), to be @samp{true} and all other objects to
+be @samp{false}.
+
+As an example, suppose the player blip wanted to lock the exit leading
+to his home so that only he and the holder of his magic wand could use
+it.  Further, suppose that blip was object #999 and the wand was #1001.
+blip would use the '@@lock' command to lock the exit with the following
+key expression:
+
+@example
+me || magic wand
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+and the system would understand this to mean
+
+@example
+#999 || #1001
+@end example
+
+That is, players could only use the exit if they were (or were carrying)
+either #999 or #1001.
+
+There is one other kind of clause that can appear in a key expression:
+
+@example
+? @var{object}
+@end example
+
+This is evaluated by testing whether the given object is unlocked for
+the candidate object; if so, this clause is true, and otherwise, it is
+false.  This allows you to have several locks all sharing some single
+other one; when the other one is changed, all of the locks change their
+behavior simultaneously.
+
+The internal representation of key expressions is stored in the property
+@code{.key} on every object.
+
+@subsubsection Key Representation For Locks
+Objects are represented by their object numbers and all other kinds of
+key expressions are represented by lists.  These lists have as their
+first element a string drawn from the following set:
+
+@example
+"&&"     "||"     "!"     "?"
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+For the first two of these, the list should be three elements long; the
+second and third elements are the representations of the key expressions
+on the left- and right-hand sides of the appropriate operator.  In the
+third case, @samp{!}, the list should be two elements long; the second
+element is again a representation of the operand.  Finally, in the @samp{?}
+case, the list is also two elements long but the second element must be
+an object number.
+
+As an example, the key expression
+
+@example
+#45  &&  ?#46  &&  (#47  ||  !#48)
+@end example
+@noindent
+would be represented as follows:
+
+@example
+@{"&&", @{"&&", #45, @{"?", #46@}@}, @{"||", #47, @{"!", #48@}@}@}
+@end example
+
+@subsection Verbs for Manipulating Locks and Keys
+The following utility verbs, defined on the @code{$lock_utils} class can
+be used by the programmer to manipulate locks on objects and key
+expressions.
+
+@deftypefn Verb num eval_key (list @var{key}, obj @var{who})
+This verb evaluates the key expression @var{key}, in the context of the
+candidate object @var{who}.  It returns @samp{1} if the @var{key} will
+allow @var{who} to pass, otherwise it returns @samp{0}. The simple
+examples below are intended to show the ways in which this verb can be
+invoked:
+
+@example
+Verb Call                     Returned
+---------                     --------
+:eval_key(#35, #35)              1
+:eval_key(@{"!", #35@}, #35)       0
+:eval_key(@{"!", #35@}, #123)      1
+@end example
+
+The @var{key} expression is given as a list, in the format described
+above.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb list parse_keyexp (string@var{keyexp}, obj @var{who})
+This verb parses the string @var{keyexp} and returns the internal
+representation of the expression, for use with
+@code{$lock_utils:eval_key}.  It is used, for example, by the verb
+@code{$player:@@lock} to parse the text given by a player into a key
+expression to store on the @code{.key} property of an object.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb none init_scanner ()
+@deftypefnx Verb none scan_token ()
+@deftypefnx Verb none match_object ()
+@deftypefnx Verb none canonicalize_spaces ()
+@deftypefnx Verb none parse_E ()
+@deftypefnx Verb none parse_A ()
+These verbs are used by the verb @code{$lock_utils:parse_keyexp} to
+perform it's parsing functions.  They can be called from user programs,
+but are really part of the @code{:parse_keyexp} verb.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb string unparse_key (list @var{keyexp})
+This verb takes the key expression @var{keyexp} and returns the input
+expression that could be used to obtain that key.  It is the reverse
+operation to @code{$lock_utils:parse_keyexp}.
+@end deftypefn
+
+A few properties are defined on the @code{$lock_utils} class, but these
+are only used internally by the lock evaluation routines, and are of no
+real interest to the programmer.
+
+@subsection The Object Utilities Class
+This class provides some utilities used to ascertain information about
+objects.
+
+@deftypefn Verb num contains (obj @var{container}, @var{target})
+This verb returns `1' if @var{target} is in any way contained by
+@var{container}.  This includes being directly in the contents list of
+the object, and also in the contents list of any object that is
+contained by @var{container}.  This verb is a partner to the
+@code{:match} verb, as they both embody the same concept.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb list all_properties (obj @var{object})
+This verb returns a list of names of all the properties of @var{object}.
+This includes properties defined on the parent(s) of this object.
+Recall that properties defined on the parent(s) of an object do not
+appear in the set given by the @code{properties(@var{thing})} primitive
+in MOO.  The @code{:all_properties} verb is useful for seeing the
+properties that an object actually has values for.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb list all_verbs (obj @var{object})
+Returns a list of all the names of the verbs defined for @var{object}.
+This includes verbs defined on the parent(s) of this object.  Again, as
+for the @code{:all_properties} verb, @code{:list_all_verbs} provides
+the complete list of verbs that define an object's behaviour.  Using the
+@code{verbs(@var{thing})} primitive in MOO lists only those verbs
+actually @dfn{defined} on @var{thing}.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb list ancestors (obj @var{object})
+This verb returns a list of the parent objects of this object.  This is
+all the objects that lie above this object in the hierarchy.  All
+objects have the @code{$root_class} in their list of parents.  For
+example, the @code{$newspaper} class object has the @code{$note} class,
+the @code{$thing} class and the @code{$root_class} as it's parents.
+
+This verb can be used by an object to tell if another object is
+descended from the same ancestor class.  Consider, for example, a
+@code{generic zapper} object.  This is an object which can be used to
+@code{shoot} at other people, with amusing and sometimes unexpected
+results.  Bearing in mind that it is unfair to try and @code{zap}
+someone who is unarmed, the verb @code{zapper:shoot} looks at the
+possessions of the victim, and decides whether s/he is armed. If this is
+the case, then the victim is fair game and deserves all s/he gets.  If
+not, the zapper refuses to shoot, with embarrassing results for the
+aggressive attacker.
+
+Considering the implementation of the @code{zapper:shoot} verb, we could
+determine if the victim has a zapper by comparing the @code{parent}s of
+the assailant's zapper and each of the victim's possessions.  However,
+this would only work if the zappers were first generation children of
+the same parent - the @code{generic zapper} class.
+
+Suppose, however, that the crafty player has built a @code{super zapper} class,
+with radar sights, based on the @code{generic zapper} class.  In this
+case, the test fails because the children of the @code{super zapper}
+class are not first generation descendants of the original @code{generic
+zapper} class.
+
+A better way to code this test is to look at the @code{:ancestors} of
+the objects, and see if the @code{generic zapper} class is numbered
+amongst them.  If this is the case, then we can definitely know who is
+armed and who isn't.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb list descendants (obj @var{object})
+Returns a list of all this object's descendants, going down the object
+hierarchy.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb obj has_verb (obj @var{object} string @var{vname})
+This verb returns the object number of @var{object} if it defines the
+verb @var{vname}.  If @var{object} does not define @var{vname}, then the
+object number of any ancestor of @var{object} that does define the verb
+is returned.  If the verb is not defined on @var{object} or any of it's
+ancestors, then @samp{0} is returned.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb obj has_property (obj @var{object} string @var{pname})
+This vernb returns @samp{1} if @var{object} has a property @var{pname},
+else it returns @samp{0}.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@subsection The Matching Utilities
+The matching utilities class, @code{$match_utils} provides several
+useful verbs for matching strings to objects.   The following facilities
+are provided:
+
+@deftypefn Verb obj match (str @var{string}, list @var{where})
+This is a general purpose matching verb.  It tries to match @var{string}
+against the list of objects in @var{where}, if @var{string} does not
+match any of the special cases, listed below.
+
+@display
+@table @code
+@item me
+This matches with the value of the @code{player} variable, i.e. the
+player who is running the verb.
+@item here
+This returns the value of the @code{player.location} property.
+@item ""
+If a @code{null} argument is supplied, this verb returns the value of
+the @code{caller} variable.
+@item $@var{class}
+This returns the value of the corresponding property on the system
+object, @code{#0}.  This is used to match with, for example,
+@code{$player}, @code{$exit} etc.  
+@item #@var{num}
+This returns the value of @var{num} as an object reference, as long as
+the object referred to is valid, and meets one of the following
+conditions:
+@itemize @bullet
+@item
+The object is in the object that called this verb.
+@item
+The object is in the same location as the player.
+@item
+The object is being carried by the player.
+@item
+The object is in the same location as the caller.
+@item
+The object is owned by the player.
+@end itemize
+@item @var{string}
+In the general case, a match is attempted using the
+@code{$string_utils:match} verb, using the value of @var{where} as the
+list of objects to match against.  The @code{aliases} property is used
+to match the string against.
+@end table
+@end display
+
+If no match is found using the above rules, a more general algorithm is
+used.  This recognises forms such as the following:
+
+@display
+@table @code
+@item @var{person}'s @var{object}
+This matches against the item @var{object} in the inventory of
+@var{person}.  The special case where @var{person} is specified by using
+@samp{my} is catered for.  Note that @code{$match_utils:match} is used
+to match the @var{person} string.
+@item @var{number} @var{object}
+This form allows you to specify a particular object in situations where
+the @var{object} string would match more than one item.  The string
+@var{number} is something like @samp{first}, @samp{second}, @dots{} or
+@samp{1st}, @samp{2nd}, @dots{}.
+@end table
+@end display
+
+These two forms can be combined, as show in the examples below.  Here we
+assume that wizard(@code{#2}) is carrying two newspapers, with object
+numbers @code{#10} and @code{#23}.  Wizard is currently standing in a
+room with object reference @code{#11}.  The verb calls are made by the
+Wizard, so that referring to @samp{me} or @samp{my} refers to the wizard.
+
+@example
+Verb Call                                   Returns
+---------                                   -------
+:match ("me", @{@})                              #2
+:match ("here", @{@})                            #11
+:match ("", @{@})                                $nothing
+:match ("$player", @{@})                         #4
+:match ("wizard", @{@})                          $failed_match
+:match ("wizard", @{#2@})                        #2
+:match ("my newspaper", @{@})                    #10
+:match ("wizard's newspaper", @{@})              $failed_match
+:match ("wizard's newspaper", @{#2@})            $ambiguous_match
+:match ("wizard's first newspaper", @{#2@})      #10
+:match ("wizard's second newspaper", @{#2@})     #23
+:match ("first newspaper", @{#2@})               $failed_match
+:match ("first newspaper", @{#10, #23@})         #10
+:match ("second newspaper", @{#10, #23@})        #23
+@end example
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb obj match_nth (str @var{string}, list @var{where}, num @var{n})
+This verb is used to match the @var{n}th occurrence of @var{string} in
+the list of objects given in @var{where}.  This verb is used, for
+example, by @code{$match_utils:match} to pick out one particular object
+from a list with more than one possible match.
+
+This verb looks at the @code{aliases} property of each of the objects in
+the @var{where} list, and returns the @var{n}th match.  If there is no
+@var{n}th match, then @code{$failed_match} is returned.  The idea behind
+this verb is to allow you to specify particular objects in situations
+where a normal match would return @var{$ambiguous_match}.  This verb
+uses @code{index()} to do it's matching, and so returns objects which
+partially match @var{string}.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb num match_verb (str @var{verb}, obj @var{what}, @var{args})
+This verb returns @samp{1} if @var{verb} is found on the object
+@var{what}.  The code for this is shown below:
+
+@example
+vrb = args[1];
+what = args[2];
+ret = what:(vrb)(args[3]);
+return ret != E_VERBNF;
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+Note that the verb being matched is executed with the @var{args} given,
+but the result returned by the verb is lost.  If the verb is not found,
+then @samp{0} is returned.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb list match_list (str @var{string}, list @var{where})
+This verb returns a list of objects taken from the list @var{where} that
+match with @var{string}.  The @code{aliases} property of each object is
+checked to see if it can be matched against @var{string}.  If it can,
+then it is added to the returned list.  This verb is used in cases where
+you wish to know all the objects that match a particular @var{string}.
+This verb uses @code{index()} to do its matching, and so returns
+objects which partially match @var{string}.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@subsection The Trigonometric Utilities
+This class provides various numerical routines, including trigonometric
+routines, generation of number sequences, and permutations and
+combinations.
+
+The trigonometric routines all take a parameter @var{x} in degrees.
+Result returned are to four decimal places, multiplied by 10000, so that
+they can be represented by numbers.  For example:
+
+@example
+Verb Call                         Result
+---------                         ------
+:sin(0)                               0
+:sin(90)                          10000
+:sin(45)                           7063
+:sin(270)                        -10000
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+The following verbs are available:
+
+@deftypefn Verb num sin (num @var{x})
+This verb returns the sine of @var{x}, where @var{x} is in degrees.  The
+returned value is to four decimal places, multiplied by 10000.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb num cos (num @var{x})
+This verb returns the cosine of @var{x}, where @var{x} is in degrees.  The
+returned value is to four decimal places, multiplied by 10000.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb num tan (num @var{x})
+This verb returns the tangent of @var{x}, where @var{x} is in degrees.
+The returned value is to four decimal places, multiplied by 10000.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb num xsin (num @var{x})
+@deftypefnx Verb num xcos (num @var{x})
+These two verbs are used by the above verbs to compute the sin, cos and
+tan values using Taylor's Theorem.  They are not really of use to the
+average programmer.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb num factorial (num @var{x})
+This verb returns the factorial, using the traditional recursive method.
+Note that @var{n} must be greater than or equal to 0.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb num pow (num @var{x}, num @var{n})
+This verb returns @var{x} raised to the @var{n}th power.  Note that
+@var{n} must be greater than or equal to 0.  Again, a recursive method
+is used to generate the result.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb list exp (num @var{x} [, num @var{n}])
+This verb calculates an @var{n}th order Taylor approximation for
+@code{e}^@var{x}.  @var{n} defaults to 5.  The result returned is in the
+format:
+
+@example
+@{@var{integer part}, @var{fractional part}@}
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+For example,
+
+@example
+>;$trig_utils:exp(1)
+ @print{}@{2, 71666@}
+
+>;$trig_utils:exp(2, 6)
+ @print{}@{7, 35555@}
+@end example
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb list fibonacci (num @var{n})
+This verbn calculates the Fibonacci sequence to the @var{n}th term, and
+returns the result as a list of numbers.  Note that @var{n} must be
+greater than or equal to zero.
+
+For example:
+
+@example
+>;$trig_utils:fibonacci(10)
+ @print{} @{0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55@}
+@end example
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb num geometric (num @var{x}, num @var{n})
+This verb calculates the value of the geometric series at @var{x} to the
+@var{n}th term. i.e., it approximates @code{1/(1-x)} when @code{|x| <
+1}. This, of course, is impossible in MOO, but someone may find it
+useful in some way. @var{n} defaults to 5. Note that @var{n} must be
+greater than or equal to zero.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb list div (num @var{n}, num @var{q})
+This verb returns a decomposition of @var{n} by @var{q} using the
+division algorithm. The returned list contains the divisor and the
+remainder.
+
+For example:
+
+@example
+Verb Call                     Returned
+---------                     --------
+;$trig_utils:div(5,1)          @{5, 0@}
+;$trig_utils:div(5,2)          @{2, 1@}
+;$trig_utils:div(5,3)          @{1, 2@}
+;$trig_utils:div(5,4)          @{1, 1@}
+;$trig_utils:div(5,5)          @{1, 0@}
+@end example
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb num combinations (num @var{n}, num @var{r})
+This verb returns the number of ways one can choose @var{r} objects from
+@var{n} distinct choices.  For example:
+
+@example
+Verb Call                              Returned
+---------                              --------
+;$trig_utils:combinations(5,1)            5  
+;$trig_utils:combinations(5,2)            10
+;$trig_utils:combinations(3,2)            3
+@end example
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb num permutations (num @var{n}, num @var{r})
+This verb returns the number of ways possible for @var{r} objects to be
+ordered given @var{n} distinct locations,using the formula 
+
+@example
+P(n,r) =  n!
+        ----
+        (n-r)!
+@end example
+
+For example:
+
+@example
+Verb Call                              Returned
+---------                              --------
+;$trig_utils:permutations(5,1)            5  
+;$trig_utils:permutations(5,2)            20
+;$trig_utils:permutations(3,2)            6
+@end example
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb list simpson (list @{num @var{a}, num @var{b}@}, list @{num @var{f(a)}, num @var{f((a+b)/2)}, num @var{f(b)}@})
+Given two endpoints, @var{a} and @var{b}, and the function's value at
+@var{a}, @var{(a+b)/2}, and @var{b}, this verb will calculate a
+numerical approximation of the integral using Simpson's rule.  The
+answer is returned in the form
+
+@example
+@{@var{integer part}, @var{fractional part}@}
+@end example
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb list abs (num @var{x})
+This verb returns the absoluate value of @var{x}.  Note that this is
+available in the server as the @code{abs()} primitive, so this verb is
+redundant.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb list parts (num @var{n}, num @var{q} [, num @var{i}])
+This verb returns a decomposition of @var{n} by @var{q} into integer and
+floating point parts.  @var{i} gives the number of digits after the
+decimal point.   If not given, @var{i} defaults to 5.  For example:
+
+@example
+Verb Call                       Returned
+---------                       --------
+;$trig_utils:parts(5,1)          @{5, 0@}
+;$trig_utils:parts(5,2)          @{2, 50000@}
+;$trig_utils:parts(3,2,2)        @{1,50@}  
+@end example
+@end deftypefn
+
+@subsection The Time Utilities
+The time utilities class, @code{$time_utils} provides a few useful
+functions for dealing with dates and times.  The following verbs are
+provided: 
+
+@deftypefn Verb str day (@var{time})
+This verb takes a time specification in @var{time}, and returns the full
+name of the day.  This verb expects @var{time} to be the result of a
+either the @code{time()} primitive or @var{ctime()}.  In the first case,
+@var{time} is a number.  In the second case, @var{time} is a string.
+
+For example,
+
+@example
+>;$time_utils:day(time())
+ @print{}"Friday"
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+The names for the days are stored on a property list called @code{days}
+on the @code{$time_utils} class.  This is indexed from a list of
+abbreviated day names, stored in a property list called @code{dayabbrs}.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb str month (@var{time})
+This verb takes a time specification in @var{time}, and returns the full
+name of the month.  This verb expects @var{time} to be the result of a
+either the @code{time()} primitive or @var{ctime()}.  In the first case,
+@var{time} is a number.  In the second case, @var{time} is a string.
+
+For example,
+
+@example
+>;$time_utils:month(time())
+ @print{}"July"
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+The names for the months are stored on a property list called
+@code{months} on the @code{$time_utils} class.  This is indexed from a
+list of abbreviated month names, stored in a property list called
+@code{monthabbrs}. 
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb string ampm (@var{time} [,num @var{precision})
+This verb takes a time specification in @var{time}, and returns string
+containing a time in the form
+@example
+[h]h[:mm[:ss]] @{a.m.|p.m.@}
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+@var{time} is either the result of the @code{time()} or @var{ctime()}
+primitives, and is either a number or a string respectively.  If given,
+@var{precision} specifies the accuracy required:
+
+@display
+@table @code
+@item 1
+Only the hours are returned.
+@item 2
+The hours and minutes are returned.
+@item 3
+The hours, minutes and seconds are returned.
+@end table
+@end display
+If not given, then @var{precision} defaults to minutes.  For example,
+
+@example
+Verb Call                   Returns
+---------                   -------
+:ampm(time())                "8:58 p.m."
+:ampm(time(), 1)             "8 p.m."
+:ampm(time(), 2)             "8:58 p.m."
+:ampm(time(), 3)             "8:58:23 p.m."
+@end example
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb num to_seconds (str @var{string})
+This verb takes a @var{string} in the form 
+@example
+hh:mm:ss
+@end example
+@noindent
+for example, created using the expression
+@example
+$string_utils:explode(ctime(time))[4]
+@end example
+@noindent
+and returns the number of seconds elapsed since 00:00:00.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb num sun ([num @var{time}])
+I can't work out what this verb is supposed to do.  I include the code
+for those interested persons who might find it useful.
+
+@example
+r = 10000;
+h = r * r + r / 2;
+time = args == @{@} ? time() | args[1];
+t = (time + 120) % 86400 / 240;
+s = 5 * ((time - 14957676) % 31556952) / 438291;
+phi = s + t + this.corr;
+cs = $trig_utils:cos(s);
+spss = ($trig_utils:sin(phi) * $trig_utils:sin(s) + h) / r - r;
+cpcs = ($trig_utils:cos(phi) * cs + h) / r - r;
+return (this.stsd * cs - this.ctcd * cpcs - this.ct * spss + h) / r - r;
+@end example
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb num from_ctime (str @var{string})
+This verb, given a string such as that returned by @code{ctime()},
+returns the corresponding time-in-seconds-since-1970 time returned by
+@code{time()}, or @code{E_DIV }if the format is wrong in some essential
+way. Note that @code{ctime()} doesn't return a time zone, yet it
+arbitrarily decides whether it's standard or daylight savings time.
+@end deftypefn
+
+The following properties are defined on the @code{$time_utils} class:
+
+@defvr Property stsd
+@defvrx Property ctcd
+@defvrx Property ct 
+@defvrx Property corr 
+These properties are used by the mysterious @code{$time_utils:sun()}
+verb.  Becuase of this, I have no comment to make on what information
+they contain, or how they are used.
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property dayabbrs 
+This property contains a list of day abbreviations, such as are found in
+the string returned by @code{ctime()}.  They are used to produce an
+index into the property @code{days}, that contains the full names of
+each day of the week.
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property days 
+This property contains a list of the seven full names of the days of the
+week. 
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property months 
+This property contains a list of the twelve full names of the months of
+the year.
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property monthabbrs 
+This property contains a list of month name abbreviations, such as are
+returned from @code{ctime()}.  They are used to produce an index into
+the property @code{months}, that contains the full names of each month
+of the year.
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property zones 
+This contains a list of some time zones, for some random purpose as yet
+unknown.  If anyone can enlighten me.....
+@end defvr
+
+@subsection The Gender Utilities
+The gender utilities class, @code{$gender_utils} contains a couple of
+verbs used for manipulating the gender pronouns of objects.
+
+@deftypefn Verb num set (obj @var{object}, str @var{gender})
+This verb is used to set the pronoun properties of @var{object},
+according to the @var{gender} specified.  @var{gender} is a string: one
+of the strings in the property list @code{$gender_utils.genders}, the
+list of rcognized genders.  
+
+The verb checks @var{gender} against the gender list, and sets the
+pronouns on @var{object} with strings taken from property lists stored
+on @code{$gender_utils}.  If the gender change is successful, the (full)
+name of the gender (e.g., @samp{female}) is returned.  @code{E_NONE} is
+returned if gender does not match any recognized gender.  Any other
+error encountered (e.g., @code{E_PERM}, @code{E_PROPNF}) is likewise
+returned and the object's pronoun properties are left unaltered.
+@end deftypefn
+
+@deftypefn Verb num add (obj @var{object} [,str @var{perms}] [, obj @var{owner}])
+This verb is used to add pronoun properties to @var{object} if they are
+not already there.  The @var{owner} and @var{perms} arguments allow you
+to optionally specify the permissions and owner of the gender properties
+that are being created.  If not given, @var{owner} defaults to the
+object's owner, and @var{perms} defaults to @samp{rc}.
+@end deftypefn
+
+The following properties are defined on the @code{$gender_utils} class:
+
+@defvr Property pronouns
+This property holds a list of the pronoun properties that can be given
+to an object.  It is used by the @code{$gender_utils:add} verb when
+adding the gender properties to an object.
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property genders
+This property holds a list of legal genders for objects, as strings.
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property ps
+This property holds the subjective pronouns for each different gender.
+If a gender is given by @code{$gender_utils.genders[@var{x}]}, then the
+corresponding gender pronouns is given by
+@code{$gender_utils:ps[@var{x}]}. 
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property po
+This property holds the objective pronouns for each different gender.
+If a gender is given by @code{$gender_utils.genders[@var{x}]}, then the
+corresponding gender pronouns is given by
+@code{$gender_utils:po[@var{x}]}. 
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property pp
+This property holds the possessive pronouns for each different gender.
+If a gender is given by @code{$gender_utils.genders[@var{x}]}, then the
+corresponding gender pronouns is given by
+@code{$gender_utils:pp[@var{x}]}. 
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property pq
+This property holds the possessive pronouns, in the noun form, for each
+different gender.  If a gender is given by
+@code{$gender_utils.genders[@var{x}]}, then the corresponding gender
+pronouns is given by @code{$gender_utils:pq[@var{x}]}.
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property pr
+This property holds the reflexive pronouns for each different gender.
+If a gender is given by @code{$gender_utils.genders[@var{x}]}, then the
+corresponding gender pronouns is given by
+@code{$gender_utils:pr[@var{x}]}. 
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property psc
+This property holds the capitalised subjective pronouns for each
+different gender.  If a gender is given by
+@code{$gender_utils.genders[@var{x}]}, then the corresponding gender
+pronouns is given by @code{$gender_utils:psc[@var{x}]}.
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property poc
+This property holds the capitalised objective pronouns for each
+different gender.  If a gender is given by
+@code{$gender_utils.genders[@var{x}]}, then the corresponding gender
+pronouns is given by @code{$gender_utils:poc[@var{x}]}.
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property ppc
+This property holds the capitalised possessive pronouns for each
+different gender.  If a gender is given by
+@code{$gender_utils.genders[@var{x}]}, then the corresponding gender
+pronouns is given by @code{$gender_utils:ppc[@var{x}]}.
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property pqc
+This property holds the capitalised possessive pronouns, in their noun
+form, for each different gender.  If a gender is given by
+@code{$gender_utils.genders[@var{x}]}, then the corresponding gender
+pronouns is given by @code{$gender_utils:pqc[@var{x}]}.
+@end defvr
+
+@defvr Property prc
+This property holds the capitalised reflexive pronouns for each
+different gender.  If a gender is given by
+@code{$gender_utils.genders[@var{x}]}, then the corresponding gender
+pronouns is given by @code{$gender_utils:prc[@var{x}]}.

+
+@unnumbered Introduction
+
+The LambdaCore database provides the facilities needed to make a
+LambdaMOO server useful for Multi User Adventuring.  If you compare the
+LambdaMOO server to a piece of computer hardware, then LambdaCore is the
+operating system needed to allow the user to do useful work.
+
+This document gives a rundown on the commands of the LambdaCore
+database, providing examples of how they are used, and some of the ideas
+behind them.  It does not cover how the commands work, nor how they are
+implemented as verbs in the MOO programming language.  A companion
+manual, @strong{The LambdaCore Programmer's Manual} covers those aspects
+of the LambdaCore database.
+
+The user may find it useful to read the other companion manual to this
+one, @dfn{The LambdaMOO Programmer's Manual}.  An understanding of MOO
+concepts and the MOO language can be useful when playing the game.
+
+@chapter The LambdaCore Player Commands
+A player interacts with the game using a large number of commands.  Most
+of these commands are implemented within the database as verbs of object
+classes.
+
+The following sections list the commands in the LambdaCore database,
+grouped roughly by function.  Some commands, such as those used for
+manipulating notes, are defined by the particular class of object they
+work on, in this case the @code{Note} class. Other commands are defined
+for one or more classes.
+
+This section intends to give a paper reference for the information given
+in the @dfn{help} system within the LambdaCore database, with some
+additional explanation of the concepts involved.
+
+Note that, for commands that can be abbreviated, the form in which the
+command is specified in the database is shown.  For example, the
+@code{inventory} command is written down as
+
+@example
+i*nventory
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+which means that this command can be invoked by the player typing any of
+the following:
+
+@example
+i
+in
+inv
+inven
+etc@dots{}
+@end example
+
+@chapter Commands That Affect Your Player
+
+The @code{$player} class defines a number of verbs that allow the player
+to change and view certain of his/her characteristics.  The following
+commands are available :
+
+@deffn Command help/information/?
+@deffnx Command help @var{topic}
+@deffnx Command help @strong{index}
+@deffnx Command help @var{object:verbname}
+@deffnx Command help $@var{something}_utils
+
+This command is used to print out entries from the online documentation
+system.  The first form prints out a summary table of contents for the
+entire help system.
+
+The second form prints out the documentation available on the given
+@var{topic}.  Many help system entries contain references to other
+entries accessible in this way.  The topic name may be abbreviated in
+either of two ways: you may give only a prefix of the complete topic
+name (e.g., @samp{bui} instead of @samp{building}) and you may omit an
+initial @samp{@@} character (e.g., @samp{who} instead of @samp{@@who}).
+If the abbreviation you give is ambiguous, you will be presented with a
+list of the matching complete topic names.
+
+The @samp{help index} commands prints out a complete list of all help topic
+names, arranged alphabetically.  It is sometimes easier to find the
+topics you're interested in this way, rather than tracing through the
+chain of cross references.
+
+Finally, we have two addtional forms that are likely to be only of use 
+to programmers:
+
+@example
+help @var{object:verbname}
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+This is used to print any documentation strings that are present at the
+beginning of the program for that verb.
+
+@example
+help $@var{foo_utils}
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+prints general information about one of the @code{$@dots{}_utils} objects
+(e.g., @code{$string_utils}, @code{$list_utils}, etc@dots{}), which are all
+libraries of generally used verbs.
+
+The commands @samp{?} and @samp{information} (usually abbreviated
+@samp{info}) are synonyms for @samp{help}.
+@end deffn
+
+@deffn Command @@quit
+This command is used to disconnect from the MOO.  This breaks your
+network connection and leaves your player sleeping.  Disconnecting in
+most parts of the MOO automatically returns your player to its
+designated home.
+@end deffn
+
+@deffn Command @@gender @var{gender}
+@deffnx Command @@gender
+
+The first form, with an argument, defines your player to have the gender
+@var{gender}.  If @var{gender} is one of the standard genders (e.g.,
+@samp{male}, @samp{female}, @samp{neuter},@dots{}), your various pronouns
+will also be set appropriately, making exits and certain other objects
+behave more pleasantly for you.
+
+The second form tells you the current definition of your player's
+gender, your current pronouns, and the complete list of standard
+genders.
+@end deffn
+
+@deffn Command @@password @var{old-password} @var{new-password}
+
+Changes your player's password (as typed in the @samp{connect} command
+when you log in to the MOO) to @var{new-password}.  For security
+reasons, you are required to type your current (soon to be old) password
+as the first argument.
+
+Your password is stored in an encrypted form in the MOO database; in
+principle, not even the wizards can tell what it is, though they can
+change it, of course.
+@end deffn
+
+@deffn Command @@sethome
+
+Sets your designated home (see @samp{help home}) to be the room you're
+in now.  If the current room wouldn't allow you to teleport in, then the
+@samp{@@sethome} command nicely refuses to set your home there.  This
+avoids later, perhaps unpleasant, surprises.
+@end deffn
+
+
+@chapter Exploring and Interacting With the Virtual World
+
+The main purpose of the core classes in the LambdaCore database is to
+allow players to construct and explore a virtual world.  This involves
+moving from one room to another, using designated pathways or
+@dfn{exits} and looking at objects and locations along the way.  The
+command given in this section are used for exploring the virtual world,
+and interacting with the game administrators, using @code{news} and
+@code{@@gripe}.  These verbs are defined by a variety of different
+classes. 
+
+@section Movement
+The descriptions of most rooms outline the directions in which exits
+exist.  Typical directions include the eight compass points
+(@samp{north}, @samp{south}, @samp{east}, @samp{west}, @samp{northeast},
+@samp{southeast}, @samp{northwest}, and @samp{southwest}), @samp{up},
+@samp{down}, and @samp{out}.
+
+To go in a particular direction, simply type the name of that direction
+(e.g, @samp{north}, @samp{up}).  The name of the direction can usually
+be abbreviated to one or two characters (e.g., @samp{n}, @samp{sw}).
+You can also type @samp{go @var{direction}} to move; this is
+particularly useful if you know you're going to type several movement
+commands in a row.
+
+In addition to such vanilla movement, some areas may contain objects
+allowing teleportation and almost all areas permit the use of the
+@samp{home} command to teleport you to your designated home.
+
+A couple of other commands are available to allow movement from one
+place to another.
+
+@deffn Command go @var{direction} @dots{}
+
+Invokes the named exits in the named order, moving through many rooms in
+a single command.
+
+@example
+blip types:
+> go n e e u e e s e
+@end example
+
+and moves quite rapidly north, east, east, up, east, east south and
+east, all in one command.
+@end deffn
+
+@deffn Command home
+
+Instantly teleports you to your designated home room.  Initially, this
+room is the @code{$player_start} room.  You can change your designated
+home using the @var{@@sethome} command.
+@end deffn
+
+@section Commands for Manipulating Objects
+Objects usually have verbs defined on them that allow players to
+manipulate and use them in various ways. Standard ones are:
+
+@display
+@table @code
+@item get
+- pick an object up and place it in your inventory
+@item drop
+- remove an object from your inventory and place it in the room
+@item put
+- take an object from your inventory and place it in a container
+@item give
+- hand an object to some other player
+@item look
+- see what an object looks like
+@end table
+@end display
+
+You can see what objects you're carrying with the @samp{inventory} command.
+
+Some specialized objects will have other commands. The programmer of the
+object will usually provide some way for you to find out what the
+commands are.  One way that works for most objects is the @samp{examine}
+command.
+
+@deffn Command inventory
+Prints a list showing every object you're carrying.
+@end deffn
+
+@deffn Command take @var{object}
+@deffnx Command get @var{object}
+@deffnx Command take @var{object} from @var{container}
+@deffnx Command get @var{object} from @var{container}
+@deffnx Command remove @var{object} from @var{container}
+
+The first two forms pick up the named object and place it in your
+inventory.  Sometimes the owner of the object won't allow it to be
+picked up for some reason.
+
+The remaining forms move the named object from inside the named
+container into your inventory.  As before, sometimes the owner of an
+object will not allow you to do this.
+@end deffn
+
+@deffn Command drop @var{object}
+@deffnx Command throw @var{object}
+Remove an object you are carrying from your inventory and put it in your
+current room.  Occasionally you may find that the owner of the room
+won't allow you to do this.
+@end deffn
+
+@deffn Command put @var{object} @strong{into} @var{container}
+@deffnx Command insert @var{object} @strong{in} @var{container}
+Moves the named object into the named container.  Sometimes the owners
+of the object and/or the container will not allow you to do this.
+@end deffn
+
+@deffn Command give @var{object} @strong{to} @var{player}
+@deffnx Command hand @var{object} @strong{to} @var{player}
+Move an object from your contents to that of another player.  This
+doesn't change the ownership of the object.  Some players may refuse to
+accept gifts and some objects may refuse to be given.
+@end deffn
+
+@deffn Command look
+@deffnx Command look @var{object}
+@deffnx Command look @var{object} @strong{in} @var{container}
+This command is used to show a description of something.  The first
+form, with no arguments, shows you the name and description of the room
+you're in, along with a list of the other objects that are there.
+
+The second form lets you look at a specific object.  Most objects have
+descriptions that may be read this way.  You can look at your own
+description using @samp{look me}.  You can set the description for an
+object or room, including yourself, with the @samp{describe} command.
+
+The third form shows you the description of an object that is inside
+some other object, including objects being carried by another player.
+@end deffn
+
+@deffn Command examine @var{object}
+@deffnx Command exam @var{object}
+
+Prints several useful pieces of information about the named object,
+including the following:
+
+@itemize @bullet 
+@item
+its full name, aliases, and object number
+@item
+its owner's name and object number
+@item
+its description
+@item
+its key expression (if it is locked and if you own it)
+@item
+its contents and their object numbers
+@item
+the @dfn{obvious} verbs defined on it
+@end itemize
+
+The @dfn{obvious} verbs are those that are readable and that can be
+invoked as commands.  To keep a verb off this list, either make it
+unreadable using @samp{@@chmod}or, if it shouldn't be used as a
+command, give it @code{args} of @samp{this none this}.
+@end deffn
+
+@chapter Interacting With Other Players
+
+There are several commands available to allow you to communicate with
+your fellow players.  Other commands are available to affect the way
+communication occurs.  The following list shows the commands used for
+these functions:
+
+@display
+@table @code
+@item say
+- talking to the other connected players in the room
+@item whisper
+- talking privately to someone in the same room
+@item page
+- yelling to someone anywhere in the MOO
+@item emote
+- non-verbal communication with others in the same room
+@item @@gag, @@listgag, @@ungag
+- screening out noise generated by certain other players
+@item news
+- reading the wizards' most recent set of general announcements
+@item @@gripe
+- sending complaints to the wizards
+@item @@typo @@bug @@idea @@suggest
+- sending complaints/ideas to the owner of the current room
+@item whereis
+- locating other players
+@item @@who
+- finding out who is currently logged in
+@item mail
+- the MOO email system
+@item @@paranoid, @@check, @@sweep
+- the facilities for detecting forged messages and eavesdropping.
+@end table
+@end display
+
+@section Communicating With Other Players
+
+Several commands are available for communicating with other players in
+the way you might do in real life.
+
+@deffn Command say @var{anything} @dots{}
+@deffnx Command "@var{anything} @dots{}
+
+Says @var{anything} out loud, so that everyone in the same room hears
+it.  This is so commonly used that there's a special abbreviation for
+it: any command-line beginning with a double-quote (@samp{"}) is treated
+as a @samp{say} command.
+
+For example, suppose that blip types the following command:
+@example
+"This is a great MOO!
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+He would see this printed on his terminal screen:
+
+@example
+You say, "This is a great MOO!"
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+Others in the same room see this:
+
+@example
+blip says, "This is a great MOO!"
+@end example
+@end deffn
+
+@deffn Command whisper "@var{text}" to @var{player}
+This command sends the message "@var{yourname} whispers, "@var{text}" to
+you " to @var{player}, if they are in the room.  This is used to send a
+private message to a another player in the room. The message is passed
+to @var{player} only.  No-one else can hear or detect the message.  For
+example, the command
+
+@example
+whisper "Hello there" to blip
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+sends the following message to blip:
+
+@example
+Ezeke whispers, "hello there" to blip.
+@end example
+@end deffn
+
+@deffn Command  page @var{player} [[with] @var{text}]
+This verb is a player command used to send messages between players who
+are not physically located in the same room in the virtual world.  You
+can imagine a @dfn{page} to be a worldwide form of shouting.  Without an
+argument, a message like
+
+@example
+You sense that blip is looking for you in The Venue Hallway.
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+is sent to the recipient of the page.  If an argument is given, it is
+treated as a message to send to the other player.  This results in the
+recipient getting a message like
+
+@example
+You sense that blip is looking for you in The Hallway
+He pages, "Hello - are you busy ?"
+@end example
+
+Paging is used primarily to attract the attention of a player, or to
+pass short messages between players in different locations.  It is not
+intended to be used for conversation.
+@end deffn
+
+The following commands can be used to set messages referred to by
+@samp{@@page}:
+
+@deffn Command @@page_origin @var{message}
+The @dfn{page origin} message determines how the recipient is told of
+your location.  The default value of this message is @samp{You sense
+that %n is looking for you in %l.}
+@end deffn
+
+@deffn Command @@page_echo @var{message}
+The @dfn{page echo} message determines the response received by anyone
+who pages you.  The default value of this message is @samp{Your message
+has been sent.}
+@end deffn
+
+@deffn Command @@page_absent @var{message}
+This message determines the response received by anyone who tries to
+page you when you aren't connected. The default value of this message is
+@samp{%n is not currently logged in.}
+@end deffn
+
+All of these undergo the usual pronoun substitutions except that in both
+cases the direct object @samp{%d} refers to the recipent of the page and
+the indirect object @samp{%i} refers to the sender.
+
+@deffn Command emote @var{anything} @dots{}
+@deffnx Command :@var{anything} @dots{}
+
+Announces @var{anything} to everyone in the same room, prepending your
+name.  This is commonly used to express various non-verbal forms of
+communication.  In fact, it is so commonly used that there's a special
+abbreviation for it: any command-line beginning with @samp{:} is treated
+as an @samp{emote} command.
+
+For example, if blip types the following:
+@example
+:wishes he were much taller@dots{}
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+Everyone in the same room would see the following message:
+@example
+blip wishes he were much taller@dots{}
+@end example
+@end deffn
+
+@section Gagging - How to Ignore Other Players and Objects
+
+Occasionally, you may run into a situation in which you'd rather not
+hear from certain other players.  It might be that they're being
+annoying, or just that whatever they're doing makes a lot of noise.
+Gagging a player will stop you from hearing the results of any task
+initiated by that player.  You can also gag a specific object, if you
+want to hear what the owner of that object says, but not the output from
+their noisy robot.  The commands to use gagging are described below:
+
+@deffn Command  @@gag @var{player or object} [@var{player or object}@dots{}]
+Add the given players to your @dfn{gag list}.  You will no longer see any
+messages that result from actions initiated by these players.  In
+particular, you will not hear them if they try to speak, emote, or
+whisper to you.
+
+For example, if blip types in the following command:
+@example
+@@gag geezer
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+and no longer hears anything that geezer says. @footnote{What a relief!}
+
+If you specify an object, then any text originating from that object
+will not be printed.
+
+For example, suppose @code{Noisy Robot} prints @samp{Hi there} every 15
+seconds.  In order to avoid seeing that, blip types the following
+command:
+
+@example
+@@gag Noisy
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+and no longer hears that robot!  Note that blip must be in the same room
+as @code{Noisy Robot} for this to work, or know its object number.
+@end deffn
+
+@deffn Command  @@ungag @var{player or object}
+@deffnx Command @@ungag @strong{everyone}
+
+Remove the given player or object (or, in the second form,
+@strong{everyone}) from your @samp{gag list}.  You will once again see
+any messages that result from actions initiated by the ungagged
+player(s) or objects.  In particular, you will once again be able to
+hear them if they speak, emote, or whisper to you.
+
+For example, suppose that blip types the following:
+@example
+@@ungag geezer
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+and is once again able to hear geezer's witty remarks.  @footnote{Ah
+well, it could be worse@dots{}}
+@end deffn
+
+@deffn Command @@listgag
+
+Shows you a list of the players and objects currently on your @dfn{gag
+list}.  You don't see any messages that result from actions initiated by
+the players or objects on this list.  In particular, you will not hear
+them if they try to speak, emote, or whisper to you.
+@end deffn
+
+
+@section Communicating With The Game Administrators
+
+Several commands are provided for communicating with the people that run
+the game.  The @code{news} command is used by the wizards to let players
+know of anything that is globally interesting.  Players can use
+@samp{@@grip} to complain to the wizards, and commands like
+@samp{@@typo} to report defects to builders and programmers.
+
+The following section describes these commands in detail.
+
+@deffn Command news
+Read the latest edition of the LambdaMOO server news, which carries
+articles concerning recent changes to the MOO server or to the main
+public classes, or whatever else is important for players to know.
+@end deffn
+
+@deffn Command @@gripe @var{anything} @dots{}
+Puts you into the MOO mail system to register a complaint (or,
+conceivably, a compliment) with the wizards.  The rest of the command
+line (the @var{anything} @dots{} part) is used as the subject line for
+the message.  More information on using the MOO mail system is given
+once you're in it.
+
+You may hear back from the wizards eventually.  For example:
+
+@example
+>@@gripe The Fruitbat
+>"How come I can't ever see the fruitbat in the Venue Clock?
+>"        -- A frustrated player
+@end example
+
+sends it, and, somewhat later, the wizards reply with a note about being
+sure to look while the Clock is chiming.
+@end deffn
+
+@deffn Command @@typo [@var{text}]
+@deffnx Command @@suggest [@var{text}]
+@deffnx Command @@bug [@var{text}]
+@deffnx Command @@idea [@var{text}]
+
+If @var{text} is given, a one-line message is sent to the owner of the
+room, presumably about something that you've noticed.  If @var{text} is
+not given, we assume you have more to say than can fit comfortably on a
+single line; the usual mail editor is invoked.  The convention is that
+@@typo is for typographical errors on the room or objects found therein,
+@@bug is for anomalous or nonintuitive behaviour of some sort, and
+@@idea/@@suggest for anything else.
+
+The usual mail editor is only invoked for this command when in rooms
+that allow free entry, i.e., rooms that are likely to allow you back
+after you are done editing your message.  Otherwise these commands will
+require @var{text} and only let you do one-line messages.  Most
+adventuring scenario rooms fall into this latter category.
+@end deffn
+
+@section Locating Other Players in the Virtual World
+
+Two commands are available for finding out where other players are
+hiding in the virtual world, as follows:
+
+@deffn Command whereis @var{player} [@var{player}@dots{}]
+@deffnx Command @@whereis @var{player} [@var{player}@dots{}]
+Returns the current location of each of the specified players.  whereis
+refers to each player's @samp{@@whereis_location} message to determine
+what should be printed.  This message defaults to
+
+@example
+"%N (%#) is in %l (%[#l])." 
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+and the usual pronoun substitutions are done.
+
+For example the default message could expand to
+
+@example
+"blip (#42) is in The Venue Manager's Office (#47)
+@end example
+@end deffn
+
+@deffn Command @@who
+@deffnx Command @@who @var{player} [@var{player} @dots{}]
+The first form lists all of the currently-connected players, along with
+the amount of time they've been connected, the amount of time they've
+been idle, and their present location in the MOO.
+
+The second form, in which a list of player names is given, shows
+information for just those players.  For any listed players that are not
+connected, we show the last login time instead of the connect/idle
+times.
+
+@samp{@@who} refers to the @samp{@@who_location} on each of the players
+to be listed in order to determine what should be printed in the
+location column.  Pronoun substitutions are done on this string in the
+usual manner.  The default value is "%l" (i.e., @code{player.location}).
+@end deffn
+
+@section Checking the Security of Your Communication
+There are several commands available that allow you to check that your
+communications with other players are secure.  The following commands
+are available:
+
+@deffn Command @@sweep
+Used when you wish to have a private conversation, and are concerned
+someone may be listening in. @code{@@sweep} tries to list the avenues by which
+information may be leaving the room. In a manner analogous to @@check,
+it assumes that you don't want to hear about your own verbs, or those
+belonging to wizards, who presumably wouldn't stoop to bugging.
+@end deffn
+
+@deffn Command @@paranoid
+@deffnx Command @@paranoid @strong{off}
+@deffnx Command @@paranoid @strong{immediate}
+@deffnx Command @@paranoid @var{number}
+
+In immediate mode, the monitor prepends everything you hear with the
+name of the character it considers responsible for the message.
+Otherwise, it keeps records of the last @var{number} (defaults to 20)
+lines you have heard. These records can be accessed by the @@check
+command.
+@end deffn
+
+@deffn Command @@check @var{options}
+Used when you are suspicious about the origin of some of the messages
+your character has just heard.  Various @var{options} can be specified:
+
+@itemize @bullet
+@item 
+the number of lines to be displayed 
+@item 
+a player's name, someone to be "trusted" during the assignment of
+responsibility for the message.
+@item a player's named prefixed by !, someone not to be "trusted".
+@end itemize
+
+Output from @@check is in columns that contain, in order, the monitor's
+best guess as to:
+@itemize @bullet
+@item 
+what object the message came from,
+@item 
+what verb on that object that was responsible,
+@item 
+whose permissions that verb was running with, and the beginning of the
+actual message.
+@end itemize
+
+@samp{@@check} operates by examining the list of verbs that were
+involved in delivering the message, and assigning responsibility to the
+first owner it sees who is not @dfn{trusted}.  By default, it trusts you
+and all the wizards.  It uses the records maintained by
+@samp{@@paranoid}, so you must have used that command before you
+received the message.
+@end deffn
+
+@chapter Using Pronoun Substitutions
+Some kinds of messages are not printed directly to players; they are
+allowed to contain special characters marking places to include the
+appropriate pronoun for some player.  For example, a builder might have
+a doorway that's very short, so that people have to crawl to get through
+it.  When they do so, the builder wants a little message like this to be
+printed:
+
+@example
+Zaphod crawls through the little doorway, bruising his knee.
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+The problem is the use of @samp{his} in the message; what if the player
+in question is female?  The correct setting of the @samp{oleave} message
+on that doorway is as follows:
+
+@example
+crawls through the little doorway, bruising %p knee.
+@end example
+
+The @samp{%p} in the message will be replaced by either @samp{his},
+@samp{her}, or @samp{its}, depending upon the gender of the player.
+
+As it happens, you can also refer to elements of the command line (e.g.,
+direct and indirect objects) the object issuing the message, and the
+location where this is all happening.  In addition one can refer to
+arbitrary string properties on these objects, or get the object numbers
+themselves.
+
+The complete set of substitutions is as follows:
+
+@display
+@table @code
+@item %% 
+=> `%'  (just in case you actually want to talk about percentages).
+@item %n 
+=> the player
+@item %t 
+=> this object (i.e., the object issuing the message,@dots{} usually)
+@item %d 
+=> the direct object from the command line
+@item %i 
+=> the indirect object from the command line
+@item %l 
+=> the location of the player
+@item %s 
+=> subject pronoun:          either @samp{he},  @samp{she}, or @samp{it}
+@item %o 
+=> object pronoun:           either @samp{him}, @samp{her}, or @samp{it}
+@item %p 
+=> posessive pronoun (adj):  either @samp{his}, @samp{her}, or @samp{its}  
+@item %q 
+=> posessive pronoun (noun): either @samp{his}, @samp{hers}, or @samp{its}
+@item %r 
+=> reflexive pronoun:  either @samp{himself}, @samp{herself}, or @samp{itself}
+@item %(foo) 
+=> player.foo 
+@item %[tfoo], %[dfoo], %[ifoo], %[lfoo]
+=> this.foo, dobj.foo, iobj.foo, and player.location.foo
+@item %#  
+=> player's object number
+@item %[#t], %[#d], %[#i], %[#l]
+=> object numbers for this, direct obj, indirect obj, and location.
+@end table
+@end display
+
+In addition there is a set of capitalized substitutions for use at the
+beginning of sentences.  These are, respectively,
+
+@itemize @bullet
+@item
+%N, %T, %D, %I, %L for object names, 
+@item
+%S, %O, %P, %Q, %R for pronouns, and
+@item
+%(Foo), %[dFoo] (== %[Dfoo] == %[DFoo]),@dots{} for general properties
+@end itemize
+
+Note that there is a special exception for player name's (the
+@code{.name} propertywhich are assumed to already be capitalized as
+desired.
+
+There may be situations where the standard algorithm, i.e., upcasing the
+first letter, yields something incorrect, in which case a
+@dfn{capitalization} for a particular string property can be specified
+explicitly.  If your object has a @code{.foo} property that is like
+this, you need merely add a @code{.fooc} (in general
+@code{.(@var{propertyname}+"c")}) specifying the correct capitalization.
+This will also work for player @code{.name}'s if you want to specify a
+capitalization that is different from your usual .@code{name}
+
+For example, Phantom makes a hand-grenade with a customizable explode
+message.  Suppose someone sets @code{grenade.explode_msg} to:
+
+@example
+"%N(%#) drops %t on %p foot.  %T explodes.  
+%L is engulfed in flames."
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+If the current location happens to be #1234("blip's house"),
+the resulting substitution may produce, eg.,
+
+@example
+Phantom(#42) drops grenade on his foot.  Grenade explodes.  
+Blip's house is engulfed in flames.
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+which contains an incorrect capitalization (The name @samp{blip} cannot
+be capitalized.  blip may remedy this by setting
+
+@example
+#1234.namec="blip's house".
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+
+A special nore for programmers: in programs, use
+@code{$string_utils:pronoun_sub()}.  Using the substitution @code{%n}
+actually calls @code{player:title()} while @code{%(name)} refers to
+@code{player.name} directly.
+
+
+@chapter The MOO Mail System
+The MOO email system allows you to send and receive messages to and from
+other players.  Whilst not approaching the complexity of a fully fledged
+email system, it does allow players to send short messages between
+themselves, normally on game related topics.  The @code{Mail Room} class
+defines a set of verbs that can be used by other MOO programs to send
+mail.  This is used, for example, by the @code{@@gripe} command, which
+uses the MOO Mail system to deliver gripes to the game administrators.
+
+The following commands are used to activate portions of the MOO mail
+system:
+
+@display
+@table @code
+@item @@mail
+- seeing a table of contents for your collection of email messages
+@item @@read
+- reading individual messages in your collection
+@item @@next
+- reading the 'next'     message in your collection
+@item @@prev
+- reading the 'previous' message in your collection
+@item @@send
+- composing and sending a message to other players
+@item @@answer
+- replying to one of the messages in your collection
+@item @@rmmail
+- discarding one or more messages from your collection
+@item @@renumber
+- renumbering the messages in your collection
+@end table
+@end display
+
+@deffn Command @@mail 
+@deffnx Command @@mail new
+
+Shows a table of contents for your MOO email message collection.  You
+are notified when you connect to the MOO if there are any such messages.
+A little arrow indicates the mail system's notion of your @dfn{current
+message}.  The first form lists all of your messages; the second form
+lists all messages after your @dfn{current message}.
+
+If you have a large number of mail messages, you can give arguments so
+that @@mail only lists the messages you're interested in.  The general
+format is
+
+@example
+@@mail @var{message-sequence}
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+where @var{message-sequence} is some combination of the following
+
+@display
+@table @code
+@item cur
+- the current message
+@item new
+- all messages after the current message
+@item @var{#}
+- (where @var{#} is a number) the message numbered @var{#} if there is one.
+@item @var{#}-@var{#}
+- all messages in the given range, if any.
+@item last:@var{#}
+- the last @var{#} messages

+@subsection .mail_forward 
+This property is a list of people (object reference numbers) who will
+receive any mail that gets sent to you.  This list may include
+non-person recipients (i.e.,descendants of @code{$mail_recipient}).  If
+this list is nonempty, you will not receive any mail yourself unless you
+are on it.  E.g., if blip is #42 and ur-blip is #43
+
+@example
+#43.mail_forward=@{@}         -- usual case; ur-blip gets his own mail.
+#43.mail_forward=@{#42@}      -- blip gets ur-blip's mail instead.
+#43.mail_forward=@{#43,#42@}  -- ur-blip gets mail and blip gets a copy.
+#43.mail_forward=@{#-1@}      -- ur-blip's mail disappears without a trace.
+@end example
+
+@subsection .mail_notify
+This property is a list of people (object reference numbers) to be
+notified whenever mail is sent to you.  This list may include anything
+that has a @code{:tell()} verb.  Notification will take place regardless
+of whether or how your mail is forwarded.  Thus, in the previous example
+
+@example
+#42.mail_notify=@{#43@}
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+means that ur-blip will be told whenever blip is sent new mail.
+
+@subsection .mail_options
+This property is a list of options that is consulted by @@send and
+@@answer to determine how messages should initially be composed
+
+The following options are available for @@answer:
+@display
+@table @code
+@item sender 
+-  replies go only to the message's author (@code{From:} line).
+@item all    
+- replies go to everyone who got the original (@code{From:} + @code{To:}

+@item incl   
+-  include original message in the body of your reply.
+@item noincl 
+-  don't include original message in the body of your reply.
+@end table

+
+The following option affects the behaviour of @@send and @@answer:
+@display
+@table @code
+@item replyto
+="@var{list of people}". A @code{Reply-to:} field will be added containing these people.
+@end table
+@end display
+
+So, for example, if ur-blip usually wants his replies to go to everyone

+@chapter Building and Creating Objects
+There are a number of commands available to players for building new
+parts of the MOO.  The primary means for players to extend the MOO is
+for them to create new objects with interesting behavior.  There are
+convenient commands for creating and recycling objects and for keeping
+track of the objects you've created.
+
+The following commands are used in the creation of objects:
+
+@display
+@table @code
+@item @@dig
+- conveniently building new rooms and exits
+@item @@create
+- making other kinds of objects
+@item @@recycle

+@item @@audit
+- listing all of your objects
+@item @@classes
+- listing all of the public classes available for your use
+@item @@move
+- moving your objects from place to place
+@end table
+@end display
+
+They are described in detail in the following paragraphs.
+
+@deffn Command @@create @var{class-name} named "@var{names}"
+@deffnx Command @@create @var{parent-object} named "@var{names}"
+
+The main command for creating objects other than rooms and exits, for
+which @samp{@@dig} is more convenient.
+
+The first argument specifies the @dfn{parent} of the new object: loosely
+speaking, the @dfn{kind} of object you're creating.  @var{class-name} is
+one of the four standard classes of objects: 
+
+@itemize @bullet
+@item
+$note
+@item 
+$letter
+@item
+$thing
+@item
+$container
+@end itemize
+
+  As time goes on, more @dfn{standard classes} may be added.  If the parent
+you have in mind for your new object isn't one of these, you may use the
+parent's name (if it's in the same room as you) or else its object
+number (e.g., #1234).
+
+The @var{names} are given in the same format as in the @samp{@@rename}
+command, as follows:
+
+@example
+@var{name}:@var{alias},@dots{},@var{alias}
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+or alternatively

+@end deffn
+
+@deffn Command @@describe @var{object} @strong{as} @var{description}
+Sets the description string of @var{object} to @var{description}.  This
+is the string that is printed out whenever someone uses the @samp{look}
+command on @var{object}.  To describe yourself, use @samp{me} as the
+@var{object}.
+
+For example, if blip types the following:
+@example
+@@describe me as "A very fine fellow, if a bit on the short side."
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+People who type @samp{look blip} now see this:
+
+@example
+A very fine fellow, if a bit on the short side.
+@end example
+
+The description of an object is kept in its @code{.description}
+property.  For multi-line descriptions, @code{.description} can be a
+list of strings.

+The first two forms are used to change the name and aliases of an
+object.  The name is what will be used in most printed descriptions of
+the object.  The aliases are the names by which players can refer to the
+object in commands.  NOTE that the name of a player may not include
+spaces and that no two players may have the same name at the same time.
+
+For example, if blip names his dog using the following command:
+
+@example
+@@rename #4237 to "Rover the Wonder Dog":Rover,dog
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+Now we'll see @samp{Rover the Wonder Dog} if we're in the same room as
+him and we can refer to him as either @samp{Rover} or just @samp{dog} in
+our commands, like @samp{pet dog}.
+
+The third form of the @@rename command is for use by programmers, to
+change the name of a verb they own.  If the @var{new-verb-name} contains
+spaces, the verb will have multiple names, one for each space-separated
+word.
+@end deffn

+@deffn Command @@recycle @var{object-name-or-number}
+Destroys the indicated object utterly and irretrievably.  Naturally, you
+may only do this to objects that you own.
+@end deffn
+
+@deffn Command @@quota
+Each player has a limit as to how many objects that player may create,
+called their @dfn{quota}.  Every object they create lowers the quota by one
+and every object they recycle increases it by one.  If the quota goes to
+zero, then that player may not create any more objects (unless, of
+course, they recycle some first).
+
+The @samp{@@quota} command prints out your current quota.
+
+To get a larger quota, talk to a wizard.  They will take a look at what
+you've done with the objects you've built so far and make a
+determination about whether or not it would be a net gain for the MOO
+community if you were to build some more things.  If so, they will
+increase your quota; if not, they will try to explain some ways in which
+you could build things that were more useful, entertaining, or otherwise
+interesting to other players.
+
+The quota mechanism is intended to solve a long-standing problem in many
+MUDs: database bloat.  The problem is that a large number of people
+build a large number of dull objects and areas that are subsequently
+never used or visited.  The database becomes quite large and difficult
+to manage without getting substantially more interesting.  With the
+quota system, we can make it possible for players to experiment and
+learn while simultaneously keeping random building to acceptable levels.
+
+It is expected that some will find the quota system distasteful or
+otherwise controversial.  It was invented by Haakon and he is always
+interested in hearing your constructive comments, suggestions and
+protests.
+@end deffn

+@deffn Command @@count
+Prints out the number of objects you own.  Do not be surprised if this

+@section Rooms and Exits
+Rooms and exits are the stuff from which the landscape of the virtual
+world is created.  A @dfn{room} is generally an instance of the generic
+room class, also referred to as @code{$room}.  An exit is an instance of
+the generic exit class, @code{$exit}.   An exit can be thought of as a
+one way tunnel leading from one room to another.  If you wish to have a
+two way exit, you have to use two exits: one going from the @dfn{source}
+to the @code{destination} and one going from the @code{destination} to
+the @code{source}.
+
+The following commands are used for creating and managing rooms and
+exits: 
+
+@deffn Command @@dig "@var{new-room-name}"
+@deffnx Command @@dig @var{exit-spec} @strong{to} "@var{new-room-name}"
+@deffnx Command @@dig @var{exit-spec} @strong{to} @var{old-room-object-number}
+This is the basic building tool.  The first form of the command creates
+a new room with the given name.  The new room is not connected to
+anywhere else; it is floating in limbo.  The @samp{@@dig} command tells
+you its object number, though, so you can use the @samp{@@move} command
+to get there easily.
+
+The second form of the command not only creates the room, but one or two
+exits linking your current location to (and possibly from) the new room.
+An @var{exit-spec} has one of the following two forms:
+
+@example
+@var{names}
+@var{names}|@var{names}
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+where the first form is used when you only want to create one exit, from
+your current room to the new room, and the second form when you also
+want an exit back, from the new room to your current room.  In any case,
+the @var{names} piece is just a list of names for the exit, separated by
+commas; these are the names of the commands players can type to use the
+exit.  It is usually a good idea to include explicitly the standard
+abbreviations for direction names (e.g., @samp{n} for @samp{north},
+@samp{se} for @samp{southeast}, etc.).  DO NOT put spaces in the names
+of exits; they are useless in MOO.
+
+The third form of the command is just like the second form except that
+no new room is created; you instead specify by object number the other
+room to/from which the new exits will connect.
+
+NOTE: You must own the room at one end or the other of the exits you
+create.  If you own both, everything is hunky-dorey.  If you own only
+one end, then after creating the exits you should write down their
+object numbers.  You must then get the owner of the other room to use
+@samp{@@add-exit} and @samp{@@add-entrance} to link your new exits to
+their room.
+
+For example,
+
+@example
+@@dig "The Conservatory"
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+creates a new room named "The Conservatory" and prints out its object number.
+
+@example

+location to the new room; players would say either @samp{north} or

+room is created.

+@section Using Letters
+A letter is a special kind of note with the added feature that it can be
+recycled by anyone who can read it.  This is often useful for notes from
+one player to another.  You create the letter as a child of the generic
+letter, @code{$letter}, encrypt it so that only you and the other player
+can read it and then either give it to the player
+in question or leave it where they will find it.  Once they've read it,
+they can use the @samp{burn} command to recycle the letter.

+@chapter Using Containers
+Containers are objects that allow you to store other objects inside
+them.  Containers may be open or closed, using the verbs @samp{open} and
+@samp{close} on the container.  Containers have a separate lock to
+determine if a player may open them.  You can make a container by
+creating a child of the standard container, @code{$container}.
+
+Containers have a large number of messages which get printed when
+players act upon them. 
+
+Containers have opacity.  This is manipulated using the following
+command :
+
+@deffn Command @@opacity @var{container} is @var{integer}
+The opacity can take on one of three values:

+- The container is opaque, and you cannot see into it when closed
+@item 2

+closed or open.
+@end table
+@end display
+
+The default opacity is @samp{1} - the container is opaque.
+@end deffn
+
+@chapter Messages on Objects
+Most objects have messages that are printed when a player succeeds or
+fails in manipulating the object in some way.  Of course, the kinds of
+messages printed are specific to the kinds of manipulations and those,
+in turn, are specific to the kind of object.  Regardless of the kind of
+object, though, there is a uniform means for listing the kinds of
+messages that can be set and then for setting them.
+
+The @samp{@@messages} command prints out all of the messages you can set
+on any object you own.
+
+To set a particular message on one of your objects use a command with
+this form:
+
+@example
+@@@var{message-name} @var{object} is "@var{message}"
+@end example
+
+where @samp{@var{message-name}} is the name of the message being set,
+@var{object} is the name or number of the object on which you want to
+set that message, and @var{message} is the actual text.
+
+For example, consider the @samp{leave} message on an exit; it is printed
+to a player when they successfully use the exit to leave a room.  To set
+the @samp{leave} message on the exit @samp{north} from the current room,
+use the command
+
+@example
+@@leave north is "You wander in a northerly way out of the room."
+@end example

+This class of commands automatically applies to any property whose name
+ends in @samp{_msg}.  Thus, in the example above, the command is setting
+the @samp{leave_msg} property of the named exit.  You can get such a
+command to work on new kinds of objects simply by giving the appropriate
+properties names that end in @samp{_msg}.

+
+@chapter Using Locks With Objects
+It is frequently useful to restrict the use of some object.  For
+example, one might want to keep people from using a particular exit
+unless they're carrying a bell, a book, and a candle.  Alternatively,
+one might allow anyone to use the exit unless they're carrying that huge
+golden coffin in the corner.  LambdaMOO supports a general locking
+mechanism designed to make such restrictions easy to implement, usually
+without any programming.
+
+Every object supports a notion of being @dfn{locked} with respect to
+certain other objects.  For example, the exit above might be locked for
+any object that was carrying the coffin object but unlocked for all
+other objects.  In general, if some object @samp{A} is locked for
+another object, @samp{B}, then @samp{B} is usually prevented from using
+@samp{A}.  Of course, the meaning of @dfn{use} in this context depends
+upon the kind of object.
+
+The various standard classes of objects use locking as follows:
+@itemize @bullet
+@item
+Rooms and containers refuse to allow any object inside them if they're locked for it.
+@item
+Exits refuse to transport any object that they're locked for.
+@item
+Things (including notes and letters) cannot be moved to locations that they're locked for.
+@end itemize
+
+There are two sides to locking:
+@itemize @bullet
+@item
+How is it specified whether one object is locked for another one?
+@item
+What is the effect of an object being locked?
+@end itemize
+
+Note that these two questions are entirely independent: one could invent
+a brand-new way to specify locking, but the effect of an exit being
+locked would be unchanged.
+
+Programmers should note that the interface between these two sides is
+the verb 
+
+@example
+@var{x}:is_unlocked_for(@var{y})
+@end example
+
+@noindent which is called by @var{x} to determine if it
+is locked for the object @var{y}.  The way in which
+@code{:is_unlocked_for} is implemented is entirely independent of the
+ways in which @var{x} uses its results.  Note that you can play on
+either side of this interface with your own objects, either defining new
+implementations of @code{:is_unlocked_for} that match your particular
+circumstances or having your objects interpret their being locked in new
+ways.
+
+The following commands are used to specify locks on objects.
+
+@deffn Command @@lock @var{object} @strong{with} @var{key expression}
+Set a lock on @var{object} to restrict its use.
+@end deffn

+@end deffn
+
+@deffn Command @@unlock_for_open @var{container}
+Clears the lock which restricts who may open @var{container}.
+@end deffn
+
+@section Keys
+LambdaMOO supports a simple but powerful notation for specifying locks
+on objects, encryption on notes, and other applications.  The idea is to
+describe a constraint that must be satisfied concerning what some object
+must be or contain in order to use some other object.
+
+The constraint is given in the form of a logical expression, made up of
+object numbers connected with the operators @samp{and}, @samp{or}, and @samp{not}
+(written @samp{&&}, @samp{||}, and @samp{!}, for compatibility with the MOO programming
+language).  When writing such expressions, though, one usually does not
+use object numbers directly, but rather gives their names, as with most
+MOO commands.
+
+These logical expressions (called @dfn{key expressions}) are always
+evaluated in the context of some particular @dfn{candidate} object, to see
+if that object meets the constraint.  To do so, we consider the
+candidate object, along with every object it contains (and the ones
+those objects contain, and so on), to be @samp{true} and all other objects to
+be @samp{false}.
+
+As an example, suppose the player blip wanted to lock the exit leading
+to his home so that only he and the holder of his magic wand could use
+it.  Further, suppose that blip was object #999 and the wand was #1001.
+blip would use the '@@lock' command to lock the exit with the following
+key expression:
+
+@example
+me || magic wand
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+and the system would understand this to mean
+
+@example
+#999 || #1001
+@end example
+
+That is, players could only use the exit if they were (or were carrying)
+either #999 or #1001.
+
+To encrypt a note so that it could only be read by blip or someone
+carrying his book, his bell, and his candle, blip would use the
+@samp{encrypt} command with the key expression
+
+@example
+me || (bell && book && candle)
+@end example
+
+Finally, to keep players from taking a large gold coffin through a
+particularly narrow exit, blip would use this key expression:
+@example
+! coffin
+@end example
+
+That is, the expression would be false for any object that was or was
+carrying the coffin.
+
+There is one other kind of clause that can appear in a key expression:
+
+@example
+? @var{object}
+@end example
+
+This is evaluated by testing whether the given object is unlocked for
+the candidate object; if so, this clause is true, and otherwise, it is
+false.  This allows you to have several locks all sharing some single
+other one; when the other one is changed, all of the locks change their
+behavior simultaneously.
+
+The internal representation of key expressions, as stored in .key on
+every object, for example, is very simple and easy to construct on the
+fly.
+
+@subsection Key Representation
+The representation of key expressions is very simple and makes it easy
+to construct new keys on the fly.
+
+Objects are represented by their object numbers and all other kinds of
+key expressions are represented by lists.  These lists have as their
+first element a string drawn from the following set:
+
+@example
+"&&"     "||"     "!"     "?"
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+For the first two of these, the list should be three elements long; the
+second and third elements are the representations of the key expressions
+on the left- and right-hand sides of the appropriate operator.  In the
+third case, @samp{!}, the list should be two elements long; the second
+element is again a representation of the operand.  Finally, in the @samp{?}
+case, the list is also two elements long but the second element must be
+an object number.
+
+As an example, the key expression
+
+@example
+#45  &&  ?#46  &&  (#47  ||  !#48)
+@end example
+@noindent
+would be represented as follows:
+
+@example
+@{"&&", @{"&&", #45, @{"?", #46@}@}, @{"||", #47, @{"!", #48@}@}@}
+@end example
+
+@chapter The MOO Editor
+One can always enter an editor by teleporting to it, or you can use one
+of the commands provided
+
+@display
+@table @code
+@item @@edit     @var{object}:@var{verb}
+invokes the Verb Editor (edits verb code)

+@end table
+@end display
+
+This will transport you to one of several special rooms that have
+editing commands available.  These editors are admittedly not as good as
+EMACS, but for those with no other editing capability on their host
+systems, it is better than nothing.
+
+In addition to the commands provided by the generic editor, individual
+editors provide their own additional commands for loading text from
+places, saving text to places, and various specialized functions.
+
+Note that a given editor only allows you one session at a time (ie. one
+verb, one note, or one mail message).  If you leave an editor without
+either aborting or compiling/saving/sending the item you're working on,
+that editor remembers what you are doing next time you enter it, whether
+you enter it by teleporting or by using the appropriate command.  Note
+that editors are periodically flushed so if you leave stuff there for
+sufficiently long, it will go away.
+
+A player may have his own @code{.edit_options} property which is a list
+containing one or more (string) flags from the following list
+
+@display
+@table @code
+@item quiet_insert
+suppresses those annoying @samp{Line n added.} or @samp{Appended@dots{}}
+messages that one gets in response to @samp{say} or @samp{emote}.  This
+is useful if you're entering a long list of lines, perhaps via some
+macro on your client, and you don't want to see an equally long list of
+@samp{Line n added@dots{}} messages.  What you do want, however is some
+indication that this all got through, which is why the @samp{.} command
+is an abbreviation for insert.
+@end table
+@end display
+
+There will be more options, some day.
+
+@section Editor Ranges
+Most editor commands act upon a particular range of lines.  Essentially,
+one needs to specify a first line and a last line.  Line numbers may be
+given in any of the following forms
+  
+@display
+@table @code
+@item n
+(i.e., the nth line of text)
+@item n^
+n-th line after/below  the current insertion point
+@item n_
+n-th line before/above the current insertion point
+@item n$
+n-th line before the end.
+@end table
+@end display
+
+In the latter three, n defaults to 1, so that @samp{^} by itself refers
+to the line below the current (i.e., the line that gets @samp{^} printed
+before it), and likewise for @samp{_} while @samp{$} refers to the last
+line.  Note that the usage depends on whether you are specifying a line
+or an insertion point (space between lines). @samp{^5} is the space
+above/before line 5, while @samp{5^} is the fifth line after/below the
+current insertion point.
+
+Ranges of lines may be specified in any of the
+following ways:
+
+@display
+@table @code
+@item @var{line}
+just that line
+@item from @var{line} to @var{line}
+what it says; the following two forms are equivalent:
+@example
+@var{line}-@var{line}            
+@var{line} @var{line}
+@end example
+@end table
+@end display
+
+With the @samp{from l to l} form, either the @strong{from} or the
+@strong{to} can be left off and it will default to whatever is usual for
+that command (usually a line above or below the insertion point).
+
+@section Editor Commands
+
+The following commands are provided by the editor classes.  Those that
+are not generic are specifically marked so.
+
+@deffn Command say @var{text}
+@deffnx Command "@var{text}
+Adds @var{text} to whatever you are editing.  The second form is
+equivalent to the first except in that it doesn't strip leading blanks
+off of @var{text} (just as with the normal @samp{say} and @samp{"}
+commands).
+
+The added text appears as a new line at the insertion point.  The
+insertion point, in turn, gets moved so as to be after the added text.
+For example:
+
+@example
+>"first line
+@print{}Line 1 added.
+
+>"  second line"
+@print{}Line 2 added.
+
+>list
+@print{}1: first line
+@print{}__2_   second line"
+@print{}^^^^
+@end example
+@end deffn
+
+@deffn Command emote @var{text}
+@deffnx Command :@var{text}
+
+Appends @var{text} to the end of the line before the insertion point.
+The second form is equivalent to the first except that it doesn't strip
+leading blanks off of @var{text} (just as with the normal @samp{emote}
+and @samp{:} commands).  The insertion point is left unmoved.
+
+@example
+>list .
+@print{}_37_ Hello there
+@print{}^38^ Oh, I'm fine.
+
+>:, how are you
+@print{}Appended to line 37.
+
+>:?
+@print{}Appended to line 37.
+
+>list .
+@print{}_37_ Hello there, how are you?
+@print{}^38^ Oh, I'm fine.
+@end example
+@end deffn
+
+@deffn Command lis*t [@var{range}] 
+Prints some subset of the current verb text.  The default range is some
+reasonable collection of lines around the current insertion point:
+currently this is @samp{8_-8^}, ie., 8 lines above the insertion point
+to 8 lines below it unless this runs up against the beginning or end of
+file, in which case we just take the first or last 16 lines, or just
+@samp{1-$} if there aren't that many.
+@end deffn
+
+@deffn Command ins*ert [@var{ins}] ["@var{text}]
+@deffnx Command .
+Many editor commands refer to an "insertion point" which is (usually)
+the place right below where the most recent line was inserted.  The
+insertion point should really be thought of as sitting @emph{between}
+lines.  In listings, the line above the insertion point is marked with
+@samp{_} while the one below is marked with @samp{^}.
+
+The @samp{insert} command, when given an argument, sets the insertion
+point.  If @var{text} is provided, a new line will be created and
+inserted as with @samp{say}.  @var{ins}, both here and in other commands
+that require specifying an insertion point (e.g., copy/move), can be one
+of
+
+@display
+@table @code          
+@item ^n
+above line n
+@item n
+above line n
+@item _n
+below line n
+@item $
+at the end
+@item ^$
+before the last line
+@item n^$
+n lines before the end
+@item .
+the current insertion point  (i.e., @samp{insert .} is a no-op)
+@item +n
+n lines below the current insertion point.
+@item -n
+n lines above the current insertion point.
+@end table
+@end display
+
+For the truly perverse, there are other combinations that also work due
+to artifacts of the parsing process, but these might go away@dots{}
+
+A single dot @samp{.} is the same as @samp{insert} without any
+arguments ie, start insertion at the current insertion point.
+@end deffn
+
+@deffn Command n*ext [@var{n}] ["@var{text}]
+Moves the insertion point down @var{n} lines.  If @var{text} is
+provided, inserts a new line there just like @samp{say}.  Equivalent to
+@samp{insert +@var{n}}.  As one might expect, @var{n} defaults to 1.
+@end deffn
+
+@deffn Command p*rev [@var{n}] ["@var{text}]
+Moves the insertion point up @var{n} lines.  If @var{text} is provided,
+a new line is inserted as with @samp{say}.  Equivalent to @samp{insert
+-@var{n}}.  As one might expect, @var{n} defaults to 1.
+@end deffn
+
+@deffn Command del*ete [@var{range}] 
+Deletes the specified range of lines.  Note that @var{range} defaults to
+the line @emph{before} the current insertion point.
+@end deffn
+
+@deffn Command f*ind / @var{str}[/[c][@var{ins}]]
+@deffnx Command / @var{str}[/[c][@var{ins}]]
+Searches for the first line after @var{ins} containing @var{str}.
+@var{ins} defaults to the current insertion point .  With the first
+form, any character (not just @samp{/}) may be used as a delimiter.  For
+the second form, you must use @samp{/}.  The @samp{c} flag, if given,
+indicates that case is to be ignored while searching
+@end deffn
+
+@deffn Command s*ubst / @var{str1} / @var{str2}[/[g][c][@var{range}]]
+Substitutes @var{str2} for @var{str1}, in all of the lines of
+@var{range}.  Any character (not just @samp{/}) may be used to delimit
+the strings.  If @var{str1} is blank, @var{str2} is inserted at the
+beginning of the line.  (For inserting a string at the end of a line use
+@samp{emote} or @samp{:}).
+
+Normally, only one substitution is done per line in the specified range,
+but if the @samp{g} flag is given, *all* instances of @var{str1} are
+replaced.  The @samp{c} flag indicates that case is not significant when
+searching for substitution instances.  @var{range} defaults to the line
+*before* the insertion point.
+
+You do @emph{not} need a space between the verb and the delimiter before
+@var{str1}.  [Bug: If you omit the space and the first whitespace in
+@var{str1} is a run of more than one space, those spaces get treated as
+one.]
+@end deffn
+
+@deffn Command m*ove [@var{range}] to @var{ins}
+5Moves the range of lines to place specified by @var{ins}.  If @var{ins}
+happens to be the current insertion point, the insertion point is moved
+to the end of the freshly moved lines.  If the range of lines contains
+the insertion point, the insertion point is carried over to the range's
+new location.
+@end deffn
+
+@deffn Command c*opy [@var{range}] to @var{ins}
+Copies the specified range of lines to place given by @var{ins}.  If
+@var{ins} happens to be the current insertion point, the insertion point
+moves to the end of the inserted lines.
+@end deffn
+
+@deffn Command join [@var{range}]
+@deffnx Command joinliteral [@var{range}]
+This command combines the lines in the specified range.  Normally,

+@chapter Dealing with Verbs and Properties
+
+Verbs and properties are the elements of objects that make them useful.
+A verb allows you to define things to do with an object, and properties
+are used to store state information about the object.  A verb can be
+thought of as a MOO code program, executed when the verb on the object
+is invoked.  This can happen if the LambdaMOO parser matches the user
+input with the verb on an object, or when another MOO code program
+explicitly calls the verb.
+
+Several commands are available to allow manipulation of properties and
+verbs.
+
+@deffn Command @@show @var{object}

+are multiple names, they should be separated by spaces and all enclosed
+in quotes:
+
+@example
+@@verb foo:"bar baz mum*ble"
+@end example
+
+The direct and indirect object specifiers (@var{dobj} and @var{iobj})
+must be either @samp{none}, @samp{this}, or @samp{any}; their meaning is
+discussed in the LambdaMOO Programmer's Manual.  The preposition
+specifier (@var{prep}) must be either @samp{none}, @samp{any}, or one of
+the prepositional phrases possible. (a prepositional phrase with more
+than one word must be enclosed in quotes ("")).  All three specifiers
+default to @samp{none}.
+
+It is also possible to specify the new verb's permissions and owner as
+part of the same command (rather than having to issue separate
+@samp{@@chmod/@@chown} commands), using the third and fourth forms above.
+
+@var{permissions} are as with @@chmod, i.e., must be some subset of
+@samp{rwxd}.  They default to @samp{rxd} (specifying @samp{w} for a verb
+is highly inadvisable).  The owner defaults to the player typing the

+This command works differently from all other MOO commands, in that it
+actually changes how the server will interpret later lines that you type
+to it.  After typing the @samp{.program} line, you are in @dfn{programming
+mode}.  All lines that you type in this mode are simply saved away in
+the server until you type a line containing only a single period (@samp{.}).
+At that point, those lines are interpreted as a MOO program and are
+checked for syntax errors.  If none are found, a message to that effect
+is printed and the code you typed is installed as the program for the
+verb in question.  In any case, after typing the @samp{.} line, you are

+program for a verb, with @samp{;} appended to the end.  Otherwise,
+@samp{return} is appended to the front and @samp{;} is appended to the

+
+@chapter Using Tasks
+A task is an execution of a MOO program.  There are three ways for tasks
+to be created in LambdaMOO:
+
+@itemize @bullet
+@item
+Every time a player types a command, a task is created to execute that
+command; we call these @dfn{command tasks}.
+@item
+Whenever a player connects or disconnects from the MOO, the server
+starts a task to do whatever processing is necessary, such as printing
+out @samp{blip has connected} to all of the players in the same room; these
+are called @dfn{server tasks}.
+@item
+The @code{fork()} statement in the programming language creates a task
+whose execution is delayed for at least some given number of seconds;
+these are @dfn{forked tasks}.
+@end itemize
+
+To prevent a maliciously- or incorrectly-written MOO program from
+running forever and monopolizing the server, limits are placed on the
+running time of every task.  One limit is that no task is allowed to run
+longer than one minute; this limit is, in practice, never reached.  The
+reason is that there is a second limit on the number of operations a
+task may execute.
+
+Every task has an associated @dfn{clock} that counts down @dfn{ticks} as the
+task executes.  The server counts one tick for every expression
+evaluation (other than variables and literals) and one for every time
+through the body of a loop.  If a task's clock winds all the way down to
+zero, the task is immediately and unceremoniously aborted.
+
+Command and server tasks are given brand-new clocks with an initial
+store of 20,000 ticks; this is enough for almost all normal uses.
+
+A forked task inherits the clock of the task that forked it, with
+however many ticks remain on it.  To allow objects like cuckoo clocks
+and other recurring tasks that do a little bit of work every once in a
+while forever, clocks also regain ticks at the rate of 25 ticks per
+second, up to the maximum of 20,000 ticks.  The seconds are counted from
+the end of the time that one task was counting down that clock to the
+time when the next user of that clock actually begins execution.
+
+Because forked tasks may exist for long periods of time before they
+begin execution, there are commands to list the ones that you own and to
+kill them before they execute.  These commands are covered in the
+following section.
+
+@deffn Command @@forked
+Gives a list of all of the forked tasks you own, along with detailed
+information about each one.  The information includes the following:
+
+@display
+@table @code
+@item Queue ID:
+A numeric identifier for the task, for use in killing it .
+@item Start Time:
+The time after which the task will begin execution.
+@item Owner:
+You, if you're not a wizard.
+@item Clock:
+The number of ticks left on the clock for the task right this moment; if
+the task does not execute immediately, this number will grow, up to a
+maximum of 20,000 ticks.
+@item Clock ID:
+It is possible for several tasks to share a single clock.  The clock ID
+is a numeric identifier for each clock, so that you can tell if one is
+being shared.
+@item Verb:
+The object and verb-name of the code that forked the task.
+@item Line:
+The line number of the first statement that the task will execute when
+it starts.  Note that the code for the verb in question may have changed
+since the task was forked; the forked task will use the version that was
+being executed when it was forked.
